4,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93l71724dyo,2025-02-05,Kay Burley retires from Sky News after 36 years,"Sky News presenter Kay Burley has announced she is retiring from the network after 36 years. 
Closing the channel's breakfast programme on Wednesday, Burley said it had been ""an honour and a privilege to work with some of the best and hardest working teams in the business"".
Burley reflected that Sky News had gone ""from a standing start to one of the most recognised and valued brands in global news"".
Burley, 64, joined Sky News in 1989 and was part of the team that covered the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the 9/11 terror attacks, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the birth of Prince George. 
In 2018, she was given her own show, The Kay Burley Show which moved into the breakfast slot a year later. 
She was suspended from presenting her show for sixth months in December 2020 for breaching coronavirus restrictions as she celebrated her 60th birthday in central London. 
Speaking at the end of her show, Burley added: ""News by its very nature is often devastating and together we've covered so many life-changing events.
""But we've also enjoyed some wonderful high notes too, haven't we - the thrill of London winning the chance to host the 2012 Olympics; a plethora of royal weddings; jubilees and who can forget days and days and days waiting for royal babies to arrive at the Lindo Wing.
""But after more than a million minutes of live TV news - more than anyone else in the world - its time for me to indulge in some of my other passions - including my love for travel.
""So, after covering 12 separate general elections - including Sir Keir Starmer's victory last year - I am retiring from Sky News - let politicians of every party just rejoice at that news!
""Thank you for waking up and tuning in every morning. I can't tell you how much I have appreciated your support over the last three and a half decades: You're awesome."" 
In 2007 Burley appeared as a contestant on ITV's Dancing on Ice and in 2018 she was part of the second series of Celebrity Hunted.
David Rhodes, executive chairman of Sky News, said Kay's commitment to Sky and legacy in television journalism is ""unmatched"". 
""We thank Kay for her huge contribution to Sky, to the art of the interview and to British journalism. And we wish her the best of luck,"" he added. 
Paying tribute to Burley, TV producer Sam McAlister said on X that she was ""an absolute icon"". 
""Smart as hell, sharp as they come, bloody amazing company,"" she wrote.

The car company said on Wednesday that the site, which has been making vehicles since 1905, would close in April, having first  announced in November that it would close.
More 1,000 jobs are at risk, although Stellantis said an additional 600 staff were needed at its plant in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, and that it would offer relocation support.
The BBC spoke to several workers who expressed fears about finding another job but did not want to move to Cheshire.
Forklift driver Dave Short, 60, said it was ""daunting"" looking for new work at his age.
""Luckily I've done a HGV training course, but I didn't know if I could find a new career as a lot is online now,"" he said.
""I feel like we've been let down by Stellantis big-time.
""We're the third most profitable company in Europe and we've done everything they wanted: cut heads, increased profit, increased vans, and they're still screwing us.""
Sandra Geary, 31, has worked at Vauxhall for 10 years as a warranty analyst, and her father also works there.
""I'm the fourth generation of my family to work here – it's part of my lineage and it feels like it flows completely through my veins,"" she said.
On news of the closure, she said: ""It's heartbreaking. I can't really describe how bad the emotions have been since November.""
Ms Geary said she would not move ""because of family"" but ""there are people considering it"".
""Quite a lot of people here have really invaluable skillsets which they'll need in Ellesmere Port,"" she said.
She is ""choosing to remain optimistic"" about finding new work.
""The skills I've learned here have been so valuable and I believe it will open doors, but it's just not something I thought I'd be having to do at 31,"" she said.
Adrian Tooth, 65, has worked at Vauxhall for most of his adult life – 44 years.
""Who's going to employ me? I'm 66 later this year and from April I'll have no job,"" he said.
""It's not worth moving to Ellesmere Port, because of my age.
""I'm not surprised at the news, but I still think it's a betrayal. They said if we do this or that; we cut the price per vehicle down – but they still shut the place. It's all to do with money.
""Vauxhall has been here for over 100 years and they [Stellantis] put another factory in Turkey and pay them half the wages.""
Peter Harding, 59, has worked at Vauxhall for 24 years, in after-sales and now as a forklift driver.
""It's devastating news for everyone. None of us expected this,"" he said.
""I've just got to go and get another job. I've got a family of four children, a wife, a mortgage, like everyone else.
""I was hoping to retire from here, to get another six to seven years. It's not looking too good at the minute but hopefully, touch wood, something will come.""
Mr Harding said he ""would consider"" moving to Ellesmere Port, ""but my wife wouldn't"".
""It's a big upheaval; two of my kids have jobs down here. To stop everything and move to Liverpool? No.""
Stellantis said it would now start ""the process of individual consultation with each of our employees"", which would ""take some time"".
""These employees are our priority and we will continue to act responsibly towards those in Luton,"" it said.
""Our focus will now be to work closely with the trade union to support employees. This will include financial support, relocation support for those who wish to transition to Ellesmere Port and onsite support activities, such as job fairs, CV writing, retraining support and wellness sessions.""

7,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98ym82nd81o,2025-02-06,Access to 'sex survey' data paused by government,"The Scottish government ""need to do better"" in how sensitive information is gathered from schoolchildren after access to a controversial census on sexual experiences was halted. 
Education secretary Jenny Gilruth told MSPs she would be raising concerns with officials after BBC Scotland News found data from the 2021 health and wellbeing survey was being advertised for use by external researchers.
The government said pupils would not be identifiable from any data gathered, but Ms Gilruth said access to the data was being put on hold.
Parents claimed they were unaware the answers might be used in this way.
Ms Gilruth said:  ""I do need to reflect that I think we need to do better in the future in relation to how that's done"", in relation to how the information was gathered.
More than 130,000 school children took part in the census, carried out in 2021. 
Conservative MSP Meghan Gallacher had raised the issue as an urgent question at Holyrood on Wednesday.
She said the census had involved children as young as 14 being asked ""highly intrusive and inappropriate questions"" about sexual experiences.
Gallacher claimed parents were not informed of the details of the survey because an ""opt-out"" model had been used.
Half of Scotland's 32 councils pulled out of the survey following concerns about a lack of informed consent and worries over the anonymity for pupils.
At the time of the survey, campaigners warned that it must protect children's right to privacy and give informed consent.
The UK's Information Commissioner's Office has guidelines on consent which say it must be ""opt-in"", rather than relying on parents or pupils specifically refusing to take part.
The education secretary said she recognised the strength of feeling on the topic and the data had only been collected on one occasion. 
She added that parental consent should have been communicated via schools.
Data from the census will be removed from the catalogue and access to it will be paused to allow time for the issue to be considered. 
Ms Gilruth said: ""I, as Cabinet Secretary, have also taken a decision to pause how we collect this data.
""I have directly discussed these concerns with the chief statistician.""
She added that ""appropriate steps"" were being taken by the statistician to reflect the ""strength of feeling"" on the survey.  
School pupils in S4 to S6 were asked to give their views on a range of subjects from physical and mental health to bullying and the pressures of school work.
However, a section on sexual relationships caused controversy, asking pupils  multiple choice questions about their experiences, including whether they'd had ""vaginal or anal sex"".
The 16 councils that went ahead with the survey were Angus, Clackmannanshire, Dumfries and Galloway, Dundee, East Renfrewshire, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Glasgow, Moray, North Ayrshire, Perth and Kinross, Renfrewshire, Scottish Borders, Shetland, South Ayrshire and Stirling.

9,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7ze00ly1zo,2025-02-05,Indian media pile into lawsuit against OpenAI chatbot ChatGPT,"India's biggest news organisations are seeking to join a lawsuit against OpenAI, the US startup behind ChatGPT, for alleged unauthorised use of their content.
The news organisations include some of India's oldest publications like The Indian Express, The Hindu, The India Today group, billionaire Gautam Adani-owned NDTV, and over a dozen others. 
OpenAI denies the allegations and told the BBC that it uses ""publicly available data"" that are in line with ""widely accepted legal precedents"".
On Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was in Delhi to discuss India's plan for a low-cost AI ecosystem with IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.
He said India ""should be one of the leaders of the AI revolution"" and said earlier comments from 2023, when he said Indian firms would struggle to compete, had been taken out of context.
""India is an incredibly important market for AI in general and for OpenAI in particular,"" local media quoted him as saying at the event.
The legal case filed against OpenAI in November by Asian News International (ANI), India's largest news agency, is the first of its kind in India.
ANI accuses ChatGPT of using its copyrighted material illegally - which OpenAI denies - and is seeking damages of 20m rupees ($230,000; £185,000).
The case holds significance for ChatGPT given its plans to expand in the country. According to a survey, India already has the largest user base of ChatGPT.
Chatbots like ChatGPT are trained on massive datasets collected by crawling through the internet. The content produced by nearly 450 news channels and 17,000 newspapers in India holds huge potential for this.
There is, however, no clarity on what material ChatGPT can legally collect and use for this purpose.
OpenAI is facing at least a dozen lawsuits across the world filed by publishers, artists and news organisations, who have all accused ChatGPT of using their content without permission.
The most prominent of them was filed by The New York Times in December 2023, in which the newspaper demanded ""billions of dollars"" in damages from OpenAI and Microsoft, its backer.
""A decision by any court would also hold some persuasive value for other similar cases around the world,"" says Vibhav Mithal, a lawyer specialising in artificial intelligence at the Indian law firm Anand and Anand.
Mr Mithal said the verdict in the lawsuit filed by ANI could ""define how these AI models will operate in the future"" and ""what copyrighted news content can be used to train AI generative models [like ChatGPT]"".
A court ruling in ANI's favour could spark further legal cases as well as opening the possibility of AI companies entering into license sharing agreements with content creators, which some companies have already started doing.
""But a ruling in OpenAI's favour will lead to more freedom to use copyrighted protected data to train AI models,"" he said.
ANI provides news to its paying subscribers and owns exclusive copyright over a large archive of text, images and videos.
In its suit filed in the Delhi High Court, ANI says that OpenAI used its content to train ChatGPT without permission. ANI has argued that this led to the chatbot getting better and has profited OpenAI.
The news agency said that before filing the suit, it had told OpenAI its content was being used unlawfully and offered to grant the company a license to use its data.
ANI says OpenAI declined the offer and put the news agency on an internal blocklist so that its data is no longer collected. It also asked ANI to disable certain web crawlers to ensure that its content was not picked up by ChatGPT.
The news agency says that despite these measures, ChatGPT picks up its content from websites of its subscribers. This has enriched OpenAI ""unjustly"", it says.
ANI also says in its suit that the chatbot produces its content verbatim for certain prompts. In some instances, ANI says, ChatGPT has falsely attributed statements to the news agency, hampering its credibility and misleading the public.
Apart from seeking compensation for damages, ANI has asked the court to direct OpenAI to stop storing and using its work.
In its response, OpenAI says it opposes the case being filed in India since the company and its servers are not located in the country and the chatbot has also not been trained there.
In December, the Federation of Indian Publishers, which claims to represent 80% of Indian publishers including the Indian offices of Penguin Random House and Oxford University Press, filed an application in court saying that they were ""directly affected"" by this case and should be allowed to present their arguments as well.
A month later, Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA), which represents leading Indian news outlets, and three other media outlets filed a similar application. They argued that while OpenAI had entered into licensing agreements with international news publishers such as the Associated Press and Financial Times, a similar model had not been followed in India.
DNPA told the court the case would affect the livelihood of journalists and the country's entire news industry. OpenAI has, however, argued that chatbots are not a ""substitute"" for news subscriptions and are not used for such purposes.
The court has not admitted these applications by the publishers yet and OpenAI has argued that the court should not hear them. 
But the judge clarified that even if these associations are allowed to argue, the court will restrict itself to ANI's claims since the other parties had not filed their own lawsuits.
Meanwhile, OpenAI told the BBC it is engaging in ""constructive partnerships and conversations"" with news organisations around the world, including India, to ""work collaboratively"".
Analysts say the lawsuits filed against ChatGPT across the world could bring into focus aspects of chatbots that have escaped scrutiny so far.
Dr Sivaramakrishnan R Guruvayur, whose research focuses on responsible use of artificial intelligence, says that the data used to train chatbots is one such aspect.
The ANI-OpenAI case will lead the court ""to evaluate the data sources"" of chatbots, he said.
Governments across the world have been grappling with how to regulate AI. In 2023, Italy blocked ChatGPT saying that the chatbot's mass collection and storage of personal data raised privacy concerns. 
The European Union approved a law to regulate AI last year.
The Indian government too has indicated plans to regulate AI. Before the 2024 election, the government issued an advisory that AI tools that were ""under-testing"" or ""unreliable"" should get government permission before launching.
It also asked AI tools to not generate responses that are illegal in India or ""threaten the integrity of the electoral process"".

The unrest was sparked by news that Hasina would address the country via social media from India, where she has been in exile since student-led protests ousted her last year.
The 77-year-old Hasina, who was in charge of Bangladesh for 20 years, was seen as an autocrat whose government ruthlessly clamped down on dissent.
On Wednesday evening, an excavator smashed down the house of Hasina's late father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who is also Bangladesh's founding president. The structure had been repurposed into a museum.
Hasina's father is widely viewed as an independence hero, but anger at his daughter has tarnished his legacy among Hasina's critics.
In a Facebook livestream, Hasina condemned the attack and demanded ""justice"".
""They can demolish a building, but they can't erase history,"" she said.
Hasina, once hailed as a pro-democracy icon, has seen her reputation sour after taking office. She has been accused of rigging elections and jailing her critics, and her administration was widely seen as corrupt.
She faces arrest warrants for cracking down on the student-led protests last year, which saw hundreds of people killed. 
While Hasina fled to India last August, anger has not dissipated against her and her Awami League partymates.
On Wednesday, protesters also vandalised and torched the houses and businesses of senior Awami League leaders. There have been calls on social media to rid the country of ""pilgrimage sites of fascism"".
Police told the BBC's Bengali service that around 700 protesters showed up at the residence on Wednesday night, and dozens of police officers were deployed.
Since Hasina's ouster, a caretaker government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has kept the country running.
But it has struggled to quell lingering unrest. Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in recent months, demanding Hasina to be prosecuted for her deadly crackdown on student protesters.
While Yunus' government tries to get Hasina extradited from India, it is also dealing with a looming economic crisis - Yunus has accused Hasina of faking Bangladesh's economic growth and laundering billions of dollars during her rule.
Yunus has pledged to hold elections in late 2025 or early 2026.

Elsewhere, the city council continue to grapple with a budget shortfall, and Posh have to take the rough with the smooth on the football pitch.
A litter picker said the volume of discarded traffic signage, bollards and sandbags he found by the roadside had reached ""epidemic"" levels.
Mark Fishpool, 68, set up the Pride in Peterborough Community Association two years ago in a bid to tidy up areas of the city where he grew up.
He said traffic management contractors were not collecting equipment routinely after roadworks and highway maintenance.
Fire crews from Stanground joined efforts to put out a wind turbine fire at a Fenland farm.
The blaze broke out at about 10:00 GMT on Sunday at the Coldham Wind Farm.
Bobbi-Leigh Taylor-Arthur is one of 56 people who attend a community meal made from surplus food organised by Peterborough FoodCycle.
She described it as ""a lifeline"".
FoodCycle served 3,112 community meals in the city last year, an increase of 49% on the previous year, according to organisers.
A man was arrested in Peterborough by police investigating disorder at a hare coursing event after dozens of 4x4s swept through fields and villages in the Cambridgeshire Fens.
The force has been investigating multiple complaints of hare coursing, criminal damage and dangerous driving after incidents took place in nine areas of Cambridgeshire on 25 January.
A Traitors contestant  told BBC Politics East he would use the skills he learned on the programme if he decided to have a career in politics,
Freddie Fraser, 20, a politics student from Peterborough, said being on the show ""really taught me skills and I can take them out to the political world, like debating, communicating, articulating your point, defending yourself and being strategic"".
He said if he did go into politics, he would want to be the ""top of that food chain"".
Money struggles are a running theme when it comes to Peterborough politics. The city's council has set out a range of measures to help it break even this year, but still faces a budget gap of more than £20m next year.
Its tight purse strings mean that an unsafe bridge at Cuckoo's Hollow in Werrington will no longer be replaced, at least in the short term. Two others, at Baron Court and Lakeside in the nature reserve, will still be upgraded.
We also learnt this week that users of the Fengate Household Recycling Centre will now have to apply for e-permits as part of a scheme aimed at reducing costs. It will mean fewer visits from people from outside the city, including from the rest of Cambridgeshire.
A regeneration scheme aimed at revitalising Peterborough's Lincoln Road is also facing a budget shortfall, of £440,000 to £642,000. The council still plans to widen the bustling road's pavements, install a new pedestrian crossing and add electric vehicle charging points but must sign off on a £3.5m contract before the work begins.
Peterborough United booked their place in the semi-finals of the EFL Trophy with a 3-2 win over Cheltenham Town.
However, the Posh also slipped closer to the League One relegation zone on Sunday after losing to Bristol Rovers 3-1.
They are next in action against Charlton on Tuesday.
Peterborough Sports got back to winning ways in the National League North with a 2-0 victory over Farsley Celtic.
Two goals from Max Booth were enough to secure all three points and take the Turbines to 11th in the table.
In ice hockey, Peterborough Phantoms bounced back from two straight defeats with a 6-0 thrashing of the Berkshire Bees.
They are now just two points behind fourth-place Hull, who they face on Sunday.

12,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg0pz8v0m8o,2025-02-06,TV chef Gino D'Acampo denies inappropriate behaviour claims,"Celebrity chef Gino D'Acampo has denied a number of allegations of inappropriate and intimidating behaviour on the set of his television programmes.
The claims came to light in an investigation published by ITV News, which said it had spoken to ""dozens"" of people who accused him of ""unacceptable"", ""distressing"" and ""horrendous"" comments.
In a statement to ITV News via his legal team, D'Acampo ""firmly denied"" the ""deeply upsetting"" allegations.
BBC News has approached his representative for comment. 
ITV News published a number of allegations from anonymous accusers who said they had worked with D'Acampo on TV productions. BBC News has not spoken to his accusers nor has it verified their claims.
They accused him of aggressive behaviour, using abusive language during outbursts on set and using sexualised language.
His behaviour allegedly left some production staff fearful and uncomfortable, ITV News reported.
It added that most people it spoke to were freelancers and had been too scared to complain at the time for fear of risking future employment.
One woman claimed D'Acampo made sexualised comments to her while she was working with him on a magazine shoot in 2011.
She said: ""I definitely saw it as some kind of power play. The very act of what he said was aggressive.""
In a response provided to ITV News by Gino D'Acampo's legal team, said the allegation had never before been raised or put to him.
""He does not recall it, nor accept that this happened. Mr D'Acampo is horrified to be accused of ""power play"" and an ""aggressive act"". He emphatically and unequivocally denies these allegations"" .
Another woman interviewed by ITV News alleged D'Acampo opened the door to her in only his boxing shorts while working on location for a TV production several years later.
She claimed he then jumped on the bed and made reference to his penis, making her feel ""disgusted"".
Gino D'Acampo's legal team said he ""categorically denies"" the allegations.
""This is the first time, six years later, he has been informed of these alleged incidents, and he does not accept them, not least because some of this is considered by Mr D'Acampo to be a fabricated work of fiction,"" they said.
Responding more broadly to the investigation, D'Acampo's representatives told ITV News that he ""firmly denied"" the claims. He said he had ""never been made aware of these matters previously"".
A statement continued: ""I am a father, husband and have worked with well over 1,500 people on around 80 productions in my career, which I have been so proud of.
""I take such matters extremely seriously,"" he said, adding that the suggestion that he acted in an improper way was ""deeply upsetting"".
D'Acampo, 48, has been a regular on UK television since the early 2000s. He has primarily worked for ITV, including on a number of cooking and travel shows, as well as making appearances on other entertainment programmes.
The Italian-born chef and broadcaster has also made appearances on BBC programmes.
In a statement, ITV said production companies ""have the primary responsibility for the duty of care of everyone they work with"".
The broadcaster said it had ""strengthened"" policies about what standards they expect from production companies it works with in the last five years.
A statement continued: ""All of the concerns and complaints raised by those who have spoken to ITN [the producer of ITV News] describe behaviour which is inappropriate and unacceptable.
""Most of them were not reported to ITV at the time. Where issues have been raised with ITV action has been taken.""
The allegations follow a recent BBC News investigation into the behaviour of another TV chef, MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace, who was accused of making inappropriate sexual comments by 13 people.
Wallace's lawyers have said it is entirely false that he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature. MasterChef's production company Banijay UK is currently investigating the claims.
In the wake of the claims about Wallace, the culture secretary Lisa Nandy warned there were ""too many cultures of silence"", and warned she was ""prepared to take further action"" if the media industry couldn't address claims of misconduct.

Is trip to Rome really Wales' biggest game in 20 years?
Guinness Men's Six Nations: Italy v Wales
Venue: Stadio Olimpico Date: Saturday, 8 February Kick-off: 14:15 GMT
Coverage: Listen live on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Wales & BBC Radio Cymru; text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app; watch on ITV1 and S4C.
Beleaguered Wales head to Rome on a record run of 13 straight defeats knowing another against Italy will put them one step closer to retaining the dreaded Wooden Spoon.
In round one, Warren Gatland's side were held to nil for the first time in a Six Nations match by a France side that barely needed to get out of second gear.
They now take on the Italians, who are smarting from the defensive errors that allowed Scotland to score five tries last week.
The Azzurri go into the match in the rare position of being favourites for a Six Nations fixture. They have won two of their last three against the Welsh but have not beaten them on home soil since 2007. 
Italy have made just one change from the side that lost to Scotland in week one with Niccolo Cannone replacing Dino Lamb in the second row.
There is also continuity among the replacements with Jacopo Trulla the only new addition as they opt for for six forwards and two backs on the bench.
Italy: 15-Allan; 14-Capuozzo, 13-Brex, 12-Menoncello, 11-Ioane; 10-P Garbisi, 9-Page-Relo; 1-Fischetti, 2-Nicotera, 3-Ferrari, 4-N Cannone, 5-Ruzza, 6-Negri, 7-Lamaro (capt), 8-L Cannone.
Replacements: 16-Lucchesi, 17-Rizzoli, 18-Riccioni, 19-Lamb, 20-Zuliani, 21-Vintcent, 22-A Garbisi, 23-Trulla.
Wales number eight Taulupe Faletau will make his first appearance since the 2023 World Cup in one of two changes to the side that were thrashed by France. 
Faletau replaces Aaron Wainwright, who drops to the bench after suffering a facial injury against the French. 
The only other alteration to the starting XV sees Eddie James make his first Test start. He comes in at inside centre with Nick Tompkins moving to 13 to replace the injured Owen Watkin.
Wales: 15-L. Williams; 14-Rogers, 13-Tompkins, 12-James, 11-Adams; 10-B Thomas, 9-T. Williams; 1-G. Thomas, 2-Lloyd, 3-H. Thomas, 4-Rowlands, 5-Jenkins, 6-Botham, 7-Morgan (capt), 8-Faletau.
Replacements: 16-Dee, 17-Smith, 18-Assiratti, 19-F. Thomas, 20-Wainwright, 21-R. Williams, 22-Edwards, 23-Murray.

Training in Nice a positive for Wales - Gatland
Italy head coach Gonzalo Quesada: ""Wales have had a day more preparation than us and that is worth gold at this stage of the competition.
""Not a single one of us thinks that this will be an easy match. It will be a fierce battle against a team that will be very different from that of 2024, a team with a lot of experience and pride.""
Wales head coach Warren Gatland: ""When you're looking at picking a squad, if you make three or four changes, do those players feel like they've been made the scapegoat?
""There's a couple of forced changes, but there's an opportunity for those guys to go out and do what we did well last week.
""Also an opportunity to fix some things to change the performance.""
Andrew Cotter: Ordinarily Italy versus Wales might not gather too much attention on a Six Nations weekend, but this year the spotlight will shine brightly on a pivotal match - victory for Wales and it could be a turning point. With defeat it would be hard to see beyond another Wooden Spoon.
A key battle will be in the midfield where Italy have the dangerous Tommaso Menoncello and Ignacio Brex partnership outside Paolo Garbisi, while injury to Owen Watkin means Eddie James getting his first start for Wales, and Ben Thomas has yet to show his best rugby at fly-half. 
Yet despite the scoreline at Murrayfield last weekend the Azzurri were comprehensively outplayed by Scotland, while even in a humbling defeat in Paris there were signs of life for Wales. 
Add to that the vast experience and talents of Taulupe Faletau returning to the back row and perhaps there is reason for Welsh hope in a game with so much at stake.
Head-to-head
After 16 defeats in a row against Wales, Italy have won two of their last three encounters.
The Azzurri are aiming to win back-to-back games against the Welsh for the first time.
Italy's last two victories against Wales both came in Cardiff. They have not won on home soil versus the Welsh since the 2007 Six Nations and have lost their last eight such meetings in a row, with the last six coming by a margin of 10 or more points.
Italy
After 26 successive Six Nations defeats at home, Italy won their last game in the tournament in Rome against Scotland last year.
They are now aiming to register back-to-back home victories in the Six Nations for only the second time after a 13-6 win over Scotland in 2012 and a 23-18 victory against France in 2013.
The Azzurri completed 212 tackles in week one, more than any other side (Wales were second with 185). 
Sebastian Negri's 26 tackles was the joint-second most by an Italian in a Six Nations match after Michele Lamaro's 27 v Scotland last year.
Wales
Defeat to Italy would equal Wales' longest ever losing run in the various guises of this championship, which was eight matches set between 1994 and 1996.
A 43-0 reverse to France in round one extended their all-time record run of defeats to 13 matches.
It was their second heaviest loss in a Six Nations fixture behind a 54-10 loss to Ireland in 2002.
The French became the first team to nil Wales since Australia in June 2007 (31-0) and the first team to do so in the Five/Six Nations since France themselves in April 1998 (51-0).
Wales' last victory was a 43-19 Rugby World Cup triumph over Georgia in October 2023.

Scotland wingers have 'that spark' - Warburton
Guinness Men's Six Nations: Scotland v Ireland
Venue: Murrayfield Date: Sunday, 9 February Kick-off: 15:00 GMT
Coverage: Watch live on BBC One & iPlayer; listen live on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio Scotland Extra & BBC Sounds; text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app.
Scotland will seek to lay down a marker in their search for a first Six Nations title by attempting to end a 10-match losing streak against defending champions Ireland.
The Scot's last win in this fixture was at Murrayfield under Vern Cotter in 2017 and all of their defeats since have been during Gregor Townsend's reign.
Ireland kicked off their title defence with a bonus-point victory over England in Dublin and were seemingly unaffected by the absence of their head coach Andy Farrell, who is on British and Irish Lions duty.
The Irish are buoyed by their impressive recent record with 13 wins from their last 14 Six Nations fixtures, although that solitary defeat was their most recent away match in the championship, a 23-22 loss to England at Twickenham in 2024.
Head coach Townsend makes three changes from the side that defeated Italy, with Tom Jordan making his first Six Nations start at inside centre, Rory Sutherland coming in at loose-head prop and Jack Dempsey at number eight. 
Matt Fagerson switches to blindside flanker to accommodate Dempsey's return, while Pierre Schoeman, Jamie Ritchie and Stafford McDowell drop to the bench. 
Lock Sam Skinner and scrum-half Jamie Dobie are included among the replacements, with George Horne and Kyle Rowe missing out.
Scotland: 15-Kinghorn, 14-Graham, 13-Jones, 12-Jordan, 11-Van der Merwe; 10-Russell (co-capt), 9-White; 1-Sutherland, 2-Cherry, 3-Z. Fagerson, 4-J. Gray, 5-Gilchrist, 6-M Fagerson, 7-R Darge (co-capt), 8-Dempsey.
Replacements: 16-Ashman, 17-Schoeman, 18-Hurd, 19-Skinner, 20-Brown, 21-Ritchie, 22-Dobie, 23-McDowall.
Ireland wing Mack Hansen was ruled out of the game on Saturday with a hamstring injury and has been replaced by Calvin Nash.
In two other changes from the side that beat England, 35-year-old former captain Peter O'Mahony replaces Ryan Baird in the back row and Robbie Henshaw comes in for Garry Ringrose at outside centre. 
Sam Prendergast is again given the nod at fly-half with Jack Crowley to be used off the bench.
Ireland: 15-Keenan; 14-Nash, 13-Henshaw, 12-Aki, 11-Lowe; 10-Prendergast, 9-Gibson-Park; 1-Porter, 2-Kelleher, 3-Bealham, 4-Ryan, 5-Beirne; 6-O'Mahony, 7-Van der Flier, 8-Doris (capt).
Replacements: 16-Sheehan, 17-Healy, 18-Clarkson, 19-Baird, 20-Conan, 21-Murray, 22-Crowley, 23-Ringrose.

Kidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders
Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend: ""It's hard to break the cycle but once you've broken it, it just becomes another match.
""A lot of it is about what we would do differently, but we also understand that Ireland have been a top team now for a while and it's harder to break that cycle when the team you're playing against has been that good and has that experience.""
Interim Ireland head coach Simon Easterby: ""We're always continually trying to evolve, as are Scotland and they showed in the autumn that they can mix it with the best.
""It's been spoken about outside the camp but we're just trying to focus on getting our own game in order and delivering a better performance than we did against England because that's what it'll take to beat Scotland in Murrayfield.""
Andrew Cotter: Two sides which bristle with attacking talents but the platform to attack only comes from powerful ball-carrying, where Ireland seem to have the edge and Scotland will simply have to match the visitors to have a chance. 
The starting midfield partnerships are fascinating - Henshaw alongside Aki in a muscular Irish combination, while Scotland have gone for the skilful Jordan to start at inside centre beside Huw Jones. That's a pairing which looks promising, but is untried for either club or country. 
Ireland certainly go into the game as favourites and 10 successive wins over the Scots will give them no end of confidence, but don't be surprised if this one is close.

Is Dupont the 'best player to ever play the game'?
Guinness Men's Six Nations: England v France
Venue: Allianz Arena, Twickenham Date: Saturday, 8 February Kick-off: 16:45 GMT
Coverage: Listen live on BBC Radio 5 Live & BBC Sounds; text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app; watch on ITV1.
England resume their Six Nations campaign against France on Saturday knowing they must win to harbour any hopes of securing a first title since 2020.
Head coach Steve Borthwick blamed inexperience for England's second-half capitulation against reigning champions Ireland last weekend, but his side's failure to sustain their high-energy approach after the break is becoming a worrying theme. 
Tournament favourites France hammered Wales without conceding a point in their opening match, a performance punctuated by peerless captain Antoine Dupont's three try assists in less than an hour. 
Dupont is attempting to lead France to a Grand Slam for the second time after their triumph in 2022, while he also masterminded the record seven-try rout of England on Les Bleus' last visit to London in the Six Nations two years ago. 
England make three changes from their defeat in Dublin. 
Fin Smith makes a first start at fly-half with Marcus Smith moving to full-back in place of Freddie Steward, who is dropped from the 23-man squad.
Tom Willis also makes his first Test start at number eight after coming off the bench in Dublin, with Ben Earl moving to openside flanker and Ben Curry dropping to the bench. 
Ollie Sleightholme replaces Cadan Murley, who has been ruled out with a foot injury.
Fit-again Jamie George and Saracens team-mate Elliot Daly are brought into the replacements. 
England: 15-M Smith; 14-Freeman, 13-Lawrence, 12-Slade, 11-Sleightholme; 10-F Smith, 9-Mitchell; 1-Genge, 2-Cowan-Dickie, 3-Stuart, 4-Itoje (capt), 5-Martin, 6-T Curry, 7-Earl, 8-Willis
Replacements: 16-George, 17-Baxter, 18-Heyes, 19-Chessum, 20-Cunningham-South, 21-B Curry, 22-Randall, 23-Daly
Romain Ntamack is suspended following his red card against Wales for a high tackle on Ben Thomas. 
He is replaced at fly-half by Matthieu Jalibert in one of two changes to the starting XV that won 43-0 last Friday night.
Damian Penaud, who missed round one with a toe injury, returns on the wing in place of Theo Attissogbe, while the bench is unchanged.
France: 15-Ramos; 14-Penaud, 13-Barassi, 12-Moefana, 11-Bielle-Biarrey; 10-Jalibert, 9-Dupont (capt); 1-Gros, 2-Mauvaka, 3-Atonio, 4-Roumat, 5-Meafou, 6-Cros, 7-Boudehent, 8-Alldritt

Are England coach Steve Borthwick's substitutions too reactive?
England head coach Steve Borthwick: ""France pose a physical challenge and a very distinct tactical challenge, particularly with that long kicking game.
""Marcus is one of the most dangerous players I've ever seen in those unstructured situations.
""He finds space between defenders that doesn't appear to be there. Marcus is a game-changing player. 
He's a player with brilliant instincts and I want him to bring all those natural instincts on to the pitch this weekend in an England shirt.""

France head coach Fabien Galthie: ""Once we saw Romain Ntamack's red card, we started to work on a solution that same night.
""From that moment, the option of Matthieu Jalibert came clear. It's obvious, it's coherent, it's logical.
""Matthieu is an example of a top quality player who has experienced good and bad moments.""
Sara Orchard:  ""Steve Borthwick's decision to select Marcus Smith at 15 allows the Harlequins player more attacking opportunities in open play. 
""This should work for England if France deploy the same long-ball tactics that they did against Wales. 
""However, if Les Bleus switch to lots of short contestable kicks like Ireland, then Smith could be under more pressure. 
""Many fans have been calling for Fin Smith get his start at 10 and his selection is credit to his consistent performances at club level and his physicality in defence.
""Despite rumours of a falling out between Fabien Galthie and Matthieu Jalibert last autumn, it appears all is well for now, as Romain Ntamack serves his ban. 
""There is no hiding, though, from the thrilling return of Damian Penaud, who scored no less than six tries for his club side Bordeaux less than a month ago in the Champions Cup. This guy is box office.""
Head-to-head
France can win four successive championship games versus England for the first time since 1978.
France's 53-10 win at Twickenham in 2023 is their biggest margin of victory against England. It was also England's record home defeat. 
England
England have lost eight of their past 13 Tests, including six of the last seven.
Steve Borthwick has suffered 15 defeats during his 29-match, two-year tenure (48% win rate).
Since winning their last Six Nations title in 2020, England have finished fifth, third, fourth and third, with nine wins from 20 games â and four of those have come against Italy.
England have lost three of their last six home games in the Six Nations (W3), as many as in their previous 29 championship fixtures (W25, D1).
However, England have won their last two home Six Nations games, both by fewer than three points.
France
France have lost just one of their last 11 Tests, winning their last four in a row.
However, they could lose consecutive matches on the road for the first time since 2021, when they were defeated by Australia in a summer Test and then at Twickenham in the Six Nations.
France have won six of their last seven away Six Nations games, including their last three in a row.
Les Bleus can win four straight Six Nations matches on the road for the first time since 2011.
France made the most attacking 22 entries (12) and scored the most points per entry (3.6) of any team in round one. They also conceded five defensive 22 entries of any side, the joint-fewest.

16,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg45py7wdrzo,2025-02-06,NI teachers reject pay offer of 5.5% ,"The majority of teachers in Northern Ireland have rejected a 5.5% pay offer for 2024/25 and are set to take action short of strike.
BBC News NI understands that some of the terms of the offer on workload and strike action had proved to be contentious.
Teaching unions had received the 5.5% offer from the employers, including the Department of Education (DE), on Friday.
It was expected to have cost the Northern Ireland Executive about £49m.
But members of a number of teaching unions have declined to ratify the offer.
BBC News NI understands that members of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) were the exception.
The NAHT's position, which has just been communicated with members, has been to accept the pay offer.
Teaching employers have said they are disappointed that the pay offer has not been ratified, and are calling on trade unions to cease their intended industrial action and bring forward proposals to resolve the dispute.
The offer from the employers had said that schools needed ""a prolonged period of stability free from industrial action and the threat of industrial action.""
It also asked teachers to accept that ""industrial action should only be taken as a last resort in any dispute"".
The offer also said that teachers should ""commit to a period free from industrial action in the context of the agreed future pay negotiation timeframes and implementation of the agreed work programme"".
Union leaders subsequently said that did not mean that teachers had to waive their right to strike.
The pay offer also specified how many days and hours teachers should work.
Unions had carried out a short consultation with teachers on the offer, but that did not provide the necessary backing for the deal.
Teaching unions had suspended planned action short of strike while negotiations on the pay deal took place, but they will now resume that action from Monday.
That is likely to affect some school activities like like school meetings, meetings with parents, administrative tasks, planning and participation in board of governors' meetings.
Some teachers who had contacted BBC News NI had expressed unhappiness with the offer, with one saying it was ""not a pay issue, but a workload issue"".
Members of the main teaching unions had previously voted for strike action and action short of strike due to the lack of a satisfactory pay offer for 2024-25.
However, while action short of strike is to resume, no strikes have yet been announced by the unions.
In a communication to members, the NASUWT union said almost 80% of about 6000 members had voted against the pay offer.
""Action Short of Strike (ASOS) will commence on Monday 10 February,"" the union said.
""This result sends a clear message that our members are united in their demand for a fair and reasonable settlement without needless conditions being imposed on teachers.
""We will continue with this action until a reasonable and fair deal is achieved for teachers.
""Your voice matters, and together, we will work towards achieving the outcome you deserve.""
In a joint statement, the Northern Ireland Teachers Council (NITC), the body which represents all unions, said that they remained ""committed to engaging in further negotiations in an effort to reach clear and unrestricted pay award for teachers for 2024/25.""
The INTO's Northern Secretary, and Secretary of NITC, Mark McTaggart said that ""members and school leaders have informed us that they were unhappy with the perceived restrictions included in last weeks offer"".
""It is disappointing that ongoing negotiations have failed to find an amicable resolution,"" he said.
""INTO remains committed to finding an uplift that is acceptable to our members, in the meantime, Action short of Strike will commence on Monday 10 February.""
The NAHT's acceptance of the offer will not impact the overall failure of NITC to accept it, which has been the decision of the majority of union members.
But NAHT members may be expecting that their acceptance of the offer to be honoured.
Where this takes their union, made up of school leaders, remains to be seen as they have affirmed their commitment to consider their next steps in consultation with their membership.
In a statement, the Management Side of the Teachers' Negotiating Committee expressed its disappointment that the NITC did not accept this years pay offer. 
It said its offer of a 5.5% cost of living increase and commitments on workload issues would require additional funding of £83m funding each year. 
Management Side chair Eve Bremner said the ""substantial"" offer was at the ""limits of affordability"" and that industrial action will have ""serious implications for children and young people's education"". 
""We are committed to achieving the best possible outcomes for pupils and teaching staff. I would therefore again call upon the trade Unions to cease their intended industrial action and bring forward proposals to resolve this dispute,"" she added.

It may even be directly connected to the M23 rebel group that made global headlines this week.
The tantalum within your device weighs less than half of the average garden pea but is essential for the efficient functioning of a smartphone, and almost all other sophisticated electronic devices.
The unique properties of this rare, blue-grey, lustrous metal – including being able to hold a high charge compared to its size, while operating in a range of temperatures - make it an ideal material for tiny capacitors, which temporarily store energy.
It is also mined in Rwanda, Brazil and Nigeria but at least 40% - and maybe more – of the element's global supply comes from DR Congo and some of the key mining areas are now under the control of the M23.
The current wave of fighting has been going on for months, but the rebels grabbed attention with Sunday's assault on the vital trading and transport hub of Goma. The city, bordering Rwanda, is a regional centre for the mining business
Over the past year, the M23 has made rapid advances across the mineral-rich east of DR Congo, taking areas where coltan – the ore from which tantalum is extracted – is mined.
Like scores of other armed groups operating in the area, the M23 began as an outfit defending the rights of an ethnic group perceived to be under threat. But as its territory has expanded, mining has become a crucial source of income, paying for fighters and weapons.
Last April, it seized Rubaya, the town at the heart of the country's coltan industry.
Mineral extraction in this region is not in the hands of multinational conglomerates - instead thousands of individuals toil in open pits that honeycomb the landscape, or underground, in extremely unsafe and unhealthy conditions.
They are part of a complex, and yet informal, network that sees the rocks removed from the ground using shovels, brought to the surface, crushed, washed, taxed, sold and then exported to be further purified and eventually smelted.
Once the M23 moved into Rubaya, the rebels established what a UN group of experts described as a ""state-like administration"", issuing permits to the diggers and traders and demanding an annual fee of $25 (£20) and $250 respectively. The M23 doubled the diggers' wages to ensure they would carry on working.
It runs the area as a monopoly making sure – through the threat of arrest and detention – that only its authorised traders are able to do business.
The M23 also charges a levy of $7 on each kilogramme of coltan. The UN group of experts estimated that as a result the M23 earns about $800,000 a month from coltan taxation in Rubaya. That money is almost certainly then used to fund the rebellion.
There is a question mark hanging over how the ore extracted from M23-controlled areas gets into the global supply chain.
Neighbouring Rwanda, which is seen as backing the M23, is at the centre of the answer, the UN experts say.
Theoretically, a traceability system - known as the International Tin Supply Chain Initiative (Itsci) - should mean that what goes into a phone handset and other electronics is sourced responsibly and avoids conflict financing and human rights abuses.
The US' Dodd-Frank Act passed in 2010, and a similar piece of EU legislation, is aimed at ensuring that companies purchasing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold – so-called ""conflict minerals"" – are not inadvertently funding violence.
But Itsci has come under some criticism.
Ken Matthysen, a security and resource management expert with independent research group Ipis, highlights that the dispersed nature of a lot of small-scale mines make it difficult for the local authorities to monitor exactly what is going on everywhere.
Itsci tags should be put on bags at the mine itself, to prove the origin of the minerals inside, but often they get transported to a collection point where it becomes harder to trace where the ore actually came from, Mr Matthysen said.
He added that there is also a possible issue with corruption.
""There is even an accusation of the state agents selling tags to traders, because they don't make a good living. So the traders then go around eastern DR Congo and they tag the bags themselves.""
In a statement to the BBC, Itsci said it covers 3,000 mine sites and that it works ""at any mine, regardless of their size or remoteness, following the goal of 'leaving no-one behind'... Excluding remote areas would be the opposite of responsible sourcing and would exacerbate potential risks.""
Itsci added that these remote communities have benefitted from its support. The scheme has also been praised for bringing ""prosperity for hundreds of thousands of small-scale miners"".
In the case of Rubaya, Itsci suspended its operations there soon after the M23 entered the town.
Nevertheless, the group has managed to continue exporting coltan.
The UN experts map a circuitous route showing how it is transported to close to the Rwandan border. It is then transferred to ""heavy-duty trucks"" that needed the road to be widened in order to accommodate them.
Rwanda has its own coltan mines but the experts say that the uncertified coltan is  mixed with Rwandan production leading to a ""significant contamination of supply chains"".
The M23 was already involved in the coltan business before the capture of Rubaya -  setting up roadblocks and charging fees to cross them, according to Mr Matthysen.
""A lot of the trade of these minerals went through M23-controlled area towards Rwanda. So even then, Rwanda was profiting from the instability in eastern DR Congo and we saw the export volumes to Rwanda were already increasing,"" he told the BBC.
Figures from the US Geological Survey show that Rwanda's coltan exports rose by 50% between 2022 and 2023. Mr Matthysen said this could not have all come from Rwanda.
In a robust defence of Rwanda's position, government spokesperson Yolande Makolo reiterated to the BBC that there were minerals and refining capacity in her own country.
""It's very cynical to take an issue like what's happening in eastern DRC, where a persecuted community is fighting for its rights... and turning [it] into an issue of material benefit,"" she added.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame has also dismissed the UN experts' reports, pouring scorn on their ""expertise"".
Much of the east of DR Congo has been blighted by conflict for many years, raising questions about who has been benefitting and whether armed groups are profiting from what is dug out of the ground there.
In order to highlight the issue and its connection to the smartphone industry, the Congolese government filed criminal complaints in France and Belgium at the end of last year against subsidiaries of the tech giant Apple, accusing it of using ""conflict minerals"".
Apple has disputed the allegation and pointed out that since early 2024, because of the escalating conflict and the difficulties of certification, it stopped sourcing tantalum, among other metals, from both DR Congo and Rwanda.
Other companies have not been so clear, which means that as the M23 seizes more territory those small bits of tantalum from the mines that they control could still make their way into the devices that we have come to rely on.

It may even be directly connected to the M23 rebel group that made global headlines this week.
The tantalum within your device weighs less than half of the average garden pea but is essential for the efficient functioning of a smartphone, and almost all other sophisticated electronic devices.
The unique properties of this rare, blue-grey, lustrous metal – including being able to hold a high charge compared to its size, while operating in a range of temperatures - make it an ideal material for tiny capacitors, which temporarily store energy.
It is also mined in Rwanda, Brazil and Nigeria but at least 40% - and maybe more – of the element's global supply comes from DR Congo and some of the key mining areas are now under the control of the M23.
The current wave of fighting has been going on for months, but the rebels grabbed attention with Sunday's assault on the vital trading and transport hub of Goma. The city, bordering Rwanda, is a regional centre for the mining business

Here are his favourite bowls – from Cajun-style Brigsten's to the OG at Commander's Palace.
There are few things that New Orleanians feel more passionately about than their hometown's famous cuisine – unsurprisingly, since the city's historical blend of cultures has given rise to a vast array of destination-worthy dishes.
Beignets, jambalaya, étouffée, po'boys, king cake and muffuletta are just a few of the city's culinary stars; their flavours reflecting its Creole, Cajun, West African and French heritage. But only one iconic NOLA dish has been named the official dish of the state of Louisiana: gumbo. 
Gumbo is a thick meat, seafood and vegetable stew whose name derives from ki ngombo, the word for okra in many West African languages. It has French and West African roots, and both Cajuns (an ethnic group of Acadian descent) and Creoles (people of mixed European, African, Caribbean and Native American ancestry) make the dish. The first recorded mention dates to the early 19th Century when it was served at a gubernatorial reception in New Orleans. 
Emeril Lagasse is an award-winning American chef and TV personality with more than 20 restaurants and 19 cookbooks. In 2002, he established the Emeril Lagasse Foundation, supporting children's educational programmes. This March marks the 35th anniversary of his namesake New Orleans restaurant, Emeril's, and he recently launched a YouTube channel, @OfficialEmeril.
There are countless variations of the Louisiana classic and no shortage of opinions on the right way to make it, but gumbo almost always starts with a roux: flour cooked in fat that forms the base of the dish. The other consistent element: the ""holy trinity"" of onion, celery and green bell pepper, ever-present in Cajun and Creole cuisine. The proteins range from seafood or poultry to ham or beef, veal or game – or a combination thereof. Tomatoes may or not be used depending on the particular preparation, but you'll often find the eponymous okra – a savoury pod-shaped green fruit that gives the stew its unique flavour.
NOLA-based chef Emeril Lagasse – famed for bringing Creole and Cajun cuisine into America's homes via his acclaimed, long-running television series, Emeril Live  – has been making and eating gumbo since he moved to New Orleans in 1982. ""I eat it five times a week and make it at home, but there is excellent gumbo all over the city,"" he says. Though he appreciates traditional gumbo – served over rice – Lagasse offers a modern take at his flagship restaurant, Emeril's, which he says has evolved quite a bit since the space first opened in 1990. ""It used to be made with seafood,"" he says, ""then we switched to chicken sausage and now it's made with lobster.""
It's not just the ingredients in the stew that have changed; the presentation has too. ""The gumbo is currently in the form of a hot canape,"" he says, ""that's the perfect concentrated taste of lobster-based gumbo made with a super dark roux."" While his son, EJ, is now running the kitchen, Lagasse frequently wanders over to the restaurant to say hello to everyone and fix himself a bowl.
Here are Lagasse's top picks for gumbo in the Big Easy.
Commander's Palace, a New Orleans institution, has been a landmark in the Garden District since its founding in 1893.
Po'boys (sometimes also written ""poor boy"") are one of NOLA's classic sandwiches – meats or seafood stuffed into crisp, light French bread. Lagasse's favourite? The po'boys at Domilise's. Inside the little yellow house on Annunciation Street, customers can choose from a whole menu of classic po'boys, but Lagasse's top picks are fried shrimp, fried oysters or roast beef. ""You need about 20 napkins to eat the roast beef po-boy. It's soaked in gravy on NOLA-style French bread,"" he says. ""People debate whether to get it dressed or not. I go for the dressed po'boy, with lettuce, tomato and pickles.""
In the 1970s, legendary Louisiana chef Paul Prudhomme helped put the restaurant on the national map for its distinct blend of Cajun and Creole cooking. In 1982, at only 23 years old, Lagasse took over from Prudhomme, continuing a tradition of ""haute Creole cuisine"", with classics such as garlic bread, turtle soup with sherry and Creole gumbo. 
Even though Lagasse left Commander's Palace in 1990, he still cites the gumbo as one of the best in NOLA because the quality of the seafood is so good. Their recipe for the stew starts with a toasty, dark roux and includes crab stock, crabs, shrimp and okra. ""Some places add chunks of seafood, but for me, that's something you do at home cause the fish starts getting stringy as it sits,"" he says.

Café Reconcile was founded in 1996 to help local 16-to-24-year-olds with career exploration and job readiness, using the restaurant as a foundation for learning and training.
Café du Monde in the French Quarter is iconic but crawling with tourists; locals get their hot sugar-dusted beignets at Café du Monde's other location on Dreyfous Drive instead. 
And for Lagasse, NOLA's best fried chicken comes from Popeye's Chicken, the international fast food chain, founded in New Orleans in 1972. ""I don't know why, it's the same formula. But I think NOLA has the best Popeye's fried chicken, no matter which one you go to."" 
While most of the hundreds of interns who have been through the 14-week programme go on to work in restaurants, others become nurses, mechanics, technicians and more. What's consistent is that they all learn to cook classic New Orleans fare like red beans and rice, po'boys and gumbo. ""Café Reconcile's chicken and sausage gumbo has a rich roux with lots of okra,"" says Lagasse, ""and it always hits the spot."" It's a win-win, according to Lagasse. ""Your meal helps support the workforce development,"" he says. ""What could be better?""

Known as the Queen of Creole cuisine, chef Leah Chase was the heart behind legendary Dooky Chase Restaurant, first opened in 1941 by her in-laws and later evolving into a meeting place for excellent food, music and dialogue.
When Lagasse craves jambalaya – a rice dish cooked with a variety of proteins – he goes to one of two places for what he defines as the best: ""one that's not too dry and not too wet."" The first is Toups' Meatery where the jambalaya is prepared with chicken and smoky andouille sausage. He also likes the jambalaya at Dooky Chase, which includes three kinds of pork, such as smoked ham, smoked chorizo and sausage. ""In the city of New Orleans, jambalaya is primarily made in a Creole style, so you'll often find tomato in it, but out in the country there's no tomato"".
In the upstairs dining room, many influential leaders of the civil rights movement, such as Martin Luther King Jr and the Reverend A L Davis, met to discuss crucial issues affecting the African American community.
Starting in 1973, every year on the Thursday before Easter (Holy Thursday), Chase would cook up to 100 gallons of her special gumbo z'herbes, made with nine types of greens. ""They do a traditional style of gumbo,"" explains Lagasse, ""but during Lent it has lots of greens – mostly collards, mustard, turnip greens and okra, and it's finished with gumbo filé.""  For decades, Chase's Lenten gumbo attracted New Orleanians from all over the city. Chase passed away in 2019 but her grandson, Edgar ""Dook"" Chase, carries on the gumbo tradition. Some say it is the best in New Orleans.

Family-owned since 1919, Casamento's on Magazine Street is primarily known for its briny Gulf Coast oysters, which peak during cool autumn and winter months. ""Locals love to go there whenever they see the open sign, which is only when the oysters are great,"" says Lagasse. He enjoys eating the plump oysters alongside their much-loved seafood gumbo, which is replete with shrimp, tomatoes and okra. Other Casamento's must-haves include their oyster stew and sandwiches, made with their signature ""pan bread"" instead of traditional French bread.

Chef Frank Brigtsen also started his culinary career as an apprentice under Paul Prudhomme, who helped him and his wife Marna open Brigtsen's in 1986 in NOLA's Riverbend neighbourhood, where he serves classic Cajun-Creole cuisine. 
""Frank is an excellent cook,"" says Lagasse, ""and I really like his filé gumbo, which is Cajun-style, meaning it has no tomatoes."" Cajun gumbo also doesn't include okra. Instead, Brigtsen thickens the stew with filé powder, a ground spice made from sassafras leaves. ""The flavour is kind of like dehydrated greens,"" explains Lagasse. The other distinction to Brigtsen's gumbo is a little unorthodox: instead of slowly frying the oil and flour for the roux, the recipe starts with heating a pot of oil to 375F, then quickly whisking in the flour. This cuts the cooking time significantly and yields a deep, complex flavour.

Starting in 1973, every year on the Thursday before Easter (Holy Thursday), Chase would cook up to 100 gallons of her special gumbo z'herbes, made with nine types of greens. ""They do a traditional style of gumbo,"" explains Lagasse, ""but during Lent it has lots of greens – mostly collards, mustard, turnip greens and okra, and it's finished with gumbo filé.""  For decades, Chase's Lenten gumbo attracted New Orleanians from all over the city. Chase passed away in 2019 but her grandson, Edgar ""Dook"" Chase, carries on the gumbo tradition. Some say it is the best in New Orleans.

Family-owned since 1919, Casamento's on Magazine Street is primarily known for its briny Gulf Coast oysters, which peak during cool autumn and winter months. ""Locals love to go there whenever they see the open sign, which is only when the oysters are great,"" says Lagasse. He enjoys eating the plump oysters alongside their much-loved seafood gumbo, which is replete with shrimp, tomatoes and okra. Other Casamento's must-haves include their oyster stew and sandwiches, made with their signature ""pan bread"" instead of traditional French bread.

Chef Frank Brigtsen also started his culinary career as an apprentice under Paul Prudhomme, who helped him and his wife Marna open Brigtsen's in 1986 in NOLA's Riverbend neighbourhood, where he serves classic Cajun-Creole cuisine. 
""Frank is an excellent cook,"" says Lagasse, ""and I really like his filé gumbo, which is Cajun-style, meaning it has no tomatoes."" Cajun gumbo also doesn't include okra. Instead, Brigtsen thickens the stew with filé powder, a ground spice made from sassafras leaves. ""The flavour is kind of like dehydrated greens,"" explains Lagasse. The other distinction to Brigtsen's gumbo is a little unorthodox: instead of slowly frying the oil and flour for the roux, the recipe starts with heating a pot of oil to 375F, then quickly whisking in the flour. This cuts the cooking time significantly and yields a deep, complex flavour.

Waitangi Day marks the first signing of New Zealand's Treaty of Waitangi or Te Tiriti o Waitangi in Māori between the British Crown and Māori chiefs in 1840.
Prime Minister Christopher Luxon - who attended an event in the South Island - described the day as an opportunity to reflect on New Zealand's past as it charts its future.
But this year's events come at a time of increased tensions, as the government pursues policies considered by some to be anti-Māori.
The introduction of a bill which sought to reinterpret the 185-year Waitangi treaty by a minority partner in the country's ruling coalition has also caused anger and dismay.
Although Luxon said that the bill would not pass into law, it brought protesters out in record numbers in a hikoi or peaceful march last November.
And on Thursday, as peaceful rallies took place nationwide, some community leaders voiced their dismay.
At a dawn ceremony in the Bay of Islands, Methodist leader Te Aroha Rountree likened the Crown-Māori relationship to a marriage, accusing the Crown of filing ""for divorce"" while Māori remained ""blissfully unaware"".
At a protest later in the day in Wellington, Anaru Ryall - an activist from Tiriti Action Group Poneke - accused the government of  ""attacking tangata whenua [Indigenous people] on all fronts,"" and eroding their rights. 
Luxon's decision not to travel to Waitangi and instead spend the day with the South Island's largest tribe - or iwi in Māori - Ngāi Tahu, also drew a mixed response. 
His political opponents accused him of cowardice, while Ngāi Tahu said it welcomed the prime minister's decision to celebrate with them and that it was a time to ""reflect on our shared history...and strengthen the relationships between tangata whenua [Māori] and the Crown, for the benefit of all our communities"". 
Speaking to large crowds at Akaroa's Ōnuku Marae, Luxon praised New Zealanders for their ongoing ability to ""heal past grievances, and move forward, adding that it was ""something many other countries around the world have failed to achieve"".
""The Crown-Māori relationship will continue to be strong and built on respect and collaboration.""
The Treaty of Waitangi was signed between many, but not all, Māori tribes and the British Crown at Waitangi on 6 February 1840 - giving both parties certain rights and privileges. 
For Māori, this includes retaining chieftainship over their lands and resources, but differences between the Māori and English versions of the treaty have left it open to interpretation. 
Nevertheless, the promise to protect indigenous land rights was repeatedly broken and the economic and cultural impacts of this, coupled with racial discrimination, has led to an inequality that is still being addressed today.
It is in this context that the anniversary of the signing of the treaty has come an important day for discussions about the state of relations between Māori and the state.
This year's anniversary comes amid ongoing scrutiny of the Treaty Principles Bill. 
The minister who has been championing the proposal - Act Party leader David Seymour - has attended events, despite being asked not to by his hapū (sub-tribe). 
Proponents of the bill say it will promote equality among New Zealanders, but those against it say it is divisive and will further disadvantage Māori.
Concern about the bill is so high that a national forum representing several iwi (Māori tribes) recently wrote a letter to King Charles - New Zealand's head of state - asking for his help. 
""We seek your intervention to ensure that the government does not diminish the Crown's honour,"" the open letter reads. 
""Please remind them to respect their responsibility to act as an honourable partner on your behalf.""
While it is unlikely the bill will pass - with Luxon and his majority National Party vowing to not back it at its second reading later this year - some of those who have participated in the public hearings about it say its very existence is an insult. 
They include former justice minister Kiritapu Allan, who described the proposed legislation as an ""abomination"".
""This is a bill that is about scrubbing us [Māori] from history,"" she said. 
Others have supported it. Economist Ananish Chaudhuri said the conversation about enshrining the Treaty principles in law was needed ""if New Zealand is to remain a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural nation"". 
He also spoke out against a situation in which different cultures in New Zealand are treated differently, saying his birth nation of India was a ""cautionary tale"". 
Other steps the government has taken that have caused anger include the dissolution the Māori Health Authority - which was set up under the last Labour government to try and create greater health equality - and the removal of Māori names from government departments.

The council said the announcement supported the government's 10-year plan to reduce pressures on the NHS by shifting focus from treatment to local prevention programmes.
It said programmes would be tailored to ""reduce health inequalities"" and ensure people of ages and backgrounds get access to the health services.
Councillor Mariam Khan said: ""This funding will enable us to continue building on the valuable work of Birmingham's public health division, and we look forward to working in collaboration with our partners across our incredible city to improve the health and wellbeing of all citizens.""

Seven Gloucestershire councils have until the end of March to submit an initial idea on whether they plan to merge.
The UK government announced a major redesign of local authorities in December,  turning two-tier council areas into unitary authorities. 
But, Gloucestershire's county and six district councils are divided on how to move forward, with some hoping for a county-wide super council, and others backing a split.
Five of Gloucestershire's seven MPs would like to see the county split into two authorities.
This could see key services managed in ""different ways"" across the county, according to Richard Stanley, Tewkesbury Borough Council's leader.
""This council does not want to see the break-up of Gloucestershire,"" he added, a sentiment shared by Gloucestershire County Council.
The proposal to split the county would see the emergence of West Gloucestershire, made up of district councils in the Forest of Dean, Gloucester and Stroud.
In the east of the county, councils in Cheltenham, Tewkesbury and the Cotswolds would merge.
The MPs backing this plan said one, bigger authority would ""not best serve the people of Gloucestershire"", the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
Talks are happening across Gloucestershire within the councils between councillors and MPs to try and reach a consensus to put forward.
The Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government said while initial ideas must be submitted by the end of March, formal applications are due by the end of November.

The artist passed away hours after having a seizure, his sister Christel told the BBC, adding that she was not clear on the exact cause of death.
Mignon's career took off in 2006 with Minédji, a hit song that remains beloved in Benin almost 20 years later.
The West African country's ministry of culture remembered Mignon as ""an emblematic figure of the first generation of urban artists of the 2000s."" 
""His songs, with their swaying rhythms and unique energy, marked an entire era and inspired many other talents,"" a statement from the ministry said.
Mignon died on Tuesday, after being admitted to hospital in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou. 
The father-of-five had moved to neighbouring Burkina Faso two years ago, for professional reasons.
After news of Mignon's death broke, his manager of nine years, Aziz Ademorou, described the musician as ""a fighter who always believed in himself"".
Mignon had demonstrated this confidence in an interview with Benin's Frissons Radio.
""I started out with my first single Mindédji, which was both a trial and a master-stroke... the public loved it,"" he said.
Mignon was also well known for creating a rhythm and dance style named Noudjihou. Noudjihou was inspired by Benin highlife music.
Mignon's music had made an impression in his new home, Burkina Faso, too. 
In January last year he produced Hymnes Aux Étalons, an African Cup of Nations anthem for Burkina Faso's national team.

The ticket for the prize draw on 24 January worth £83,474,081.80 was purchased in the UK.
The prize winner matched all five main numbers - 02, 11, 19, 30 and 49 - as well as the Lucky Star numbers, which were 03 and 08. 
Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at National Lottery operator Allwyn, said it was ""absolutely incredible news"" that someone had come forward. Their claim needs to be verified before they receive a payout.
""Everyone dreams of that huge win when they buy their EuroMillions ticket - and for this lucky ticket-holder this dream has become a reality,"" he said, adding: ""Imagine all the possibilities that are now within their grasp.""
Once the EuroMillions ticket has been validated and paid, the ticket-holder will then decide whether they wish to disclose their identity.
Unless they decide to go public, there will be no information on where the ticket was purchased, nor whether they were an individual or syndicate winner, Allwyn said.
The National Lottery said the jackpot was number 23 on their list of the ""most spectacular"" wins - ie the largest - of all time.
In July 2022, an anonymous UK ticket-holder scooped the record EuroMillions jackpot of £195m. 
That same year, Joe and Jess Thwaite, from Gloucester, won a then record-breaking £184,262,899 with a Lucky Dip ticket for the draw on 10 May.
The UK's third biggest win came after an anonymous ticket-holder claimed the £177m jackpot in the draw in November last year.
According to the National Lottery, there are still nine EuroMillions prizes yet to be claimed by UK ticket-holders, with the largest standing at £1m.
Ticket-holders have 180 days from the day of the draw to claim their prize.

Foreign Secretary David Lammy said action had been taken ""following Russia's recent expulsion of a British diplomat"" in November. 
Moscow accused the diplomat of giving false information and spying as grounds for asking him to leave. 
The government said the UK ""will not stand for intimidation of our staff in this way"" and that ""any further action taken by Russia will be considered an escalation and responded to accordingly"".
Russia's ambassador to the UK Andrey Kelin, who has been in post since 2019, was summoned to the Foreign Office to be informed one of his diplomats was having their accreditation revoked.
An accreditation is a recognition by a government of a diplomat's status, and gives them certain immunities depending on rank.
""We are unapologetic about protecting our national interests,"" Lammy said. 
""My message to Russia is clear - if you take action against us, we will respond.""
The Russian Foreign Ministry said it intended to retaliate to the expulsion, in a statement given to the state-owned Tass news agency. 
Moscow revoked the British diplomat's accreditation in November, accusing them of spying and ordering the individual to leave the country within two weeks.
Russian state-run news agencies reported that the country's security service FSB had accused the diplomat of providing false information on his documents and carrying out espionage activities. 
His photo and name was also shared on Russian TV bulletins. 
At the time, the Foreign Office dismissed Russia's accusations as ""baseless"" and said it was considering a response. 
Russia previously said it planned to take further action should the UK respond to its own expulsion.
Diplomatic relations between the UK and Russia have worsened since the latter's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Since then, expulsions of diplomats have become increasingly common.
In September last year, Russia announced that the accreditation of six British diplomats in Moscow had been revoked, requiring them to leave the country. 
And in May, British diplomat Capt Adrian Coghill was given a week to leave Russia, days after the Russian defence attaché was expelled from London for alleged espionage as an ""undeclared military intelligence officer"".
A number of British politicians and members of the press have also been barred from entering Russia since the war began, including senior government officials and journalists from the BBC, Sky News and Channel 4.
Most recently, 30 more people, including Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and other Labour cabinet members, were added to Russia's ""stop list"".
Lammy and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer were added to the list in 2022, as was now-Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch.

West Northamptonshire Council received £1.368m from the government's Brownfield Land Release Fund (BLRF) to restore the St James Bus Depot, fronting the A4500 in Northampton.
Work on the derelict building is expected to begin in autumn 2025 and will take up to a year to complete.
""This redevelopment is a fantastic opportunity to transform a gateway site into Northampton town centre,"" said Dan Lister, Conservative cabinet member for local economy, culture and leisure. 
""By revitalising the St James Depot site, we are not only preserving the historical significance of the Transport Office but also creating much-needed housing and boosting the local economy.""
The council has identified a need for quality housing in the area, but a council report said developing this site posed a range of ""significant challenges"".
Its cabinet will meet on next Tuesday to discuss the next phase of plans and assign contractors.
Contracts for the repair work must be signed by the end of March in order for the funding to be released.
The vision for the project includes the retention of the original tram facades, with ""tramshed terraces"" in between, and newbuild maisonettes and townhouses across the rest of the site.
The council will then seek a development partner for the housing scheme once the remedial works have finished.

An application for retrospective permission was submitted by directors Curtis Salmon and Katie Elnor, but denied by Broxtowe council.
An amended plan to retain the area with a new fence to curtail any disturbance to people nearby was then recommended for refusal but councillors overruled this at a meeting on Wednesday and will allow the decking to remain.
Addressing the committee, Ms Elnor said The Berliner maintained ""strict standards"" on any noise from the venue.
She said the impact of not being unable to retain an outdoor area would be ""significant"" for the business.
Beeston West ward councillor Greg Marshall said it was ""frustrating"" that the council had ""dragged on"" the issue for what he described as ""a brilliant business"".

West Northamptonshire Council received £1.368m from the government's Brownfield Land Release Fund (BLRF) to restore the St James Bus Depot, fronting the A4500 in Northampton.
Work on the derelict building is expected to begin in autumn 2025 and will take up to a year to complete.
""This redevelopment is a fantastic opportunity to transform a gateway site into Northampton town centre,"" said Dan Lister, Conservative cabinet member for local economy, culture and leisure. 
""By revitalising the St James Depot site, we are not only preserving the historical significance of the Transport Office but also creating much-needed housing and boosting the local economy.""
The council has identified a need for quality housing in the area, but a council report said developing this site posed a range of ""significant challenges"".
Its cabinet will meet on next Tuesday to discuss the next phase of plans and assign contractors.
Contracts for the repair work must be signed by the end of March in order for the funding to be released.
The vision for the project includes the retention of the original tram facades, with ""tramshed terraces"" in between, and newbuild maisonettes and townhouses across the rest of the site.
The council will then seek a development partner for the housing scheme once the remedial works have finished.

Their movements have been monitored on a hidden cubcam at Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire.
The youngsters, born on 25 November 2024, have up until now been spending their time in their indoor den with mother Winta.
The zoo said the nine-week-old cubs would be sexed at their first health check next week.
The zoo said the trio were vitally important for protecting the lineage of their ""sadly threatened"" sub-species which was only officially recognised in 2017.
Three quarters of African lion populations are declining, which the World Wildlife Fund blames on habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict and poaching.
There are between 23,000 and 39,000 lions left in the wild, according to estimates from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
Whipsnade Zoo said every visit supported the global conservation work of Zoological Society of London.

The first programme was filmed inside the former Superdry unit in the Buttermarket shopping centre in Ipswich on Thursday, 30 January.
The show, called This is Scripted, is a collaboration between Scripted Development and This Is Ipswich.
Producer and host Raph Adams said: ""The whole premise of it was to magnify men's mental health, something that I am fully engaged with.""
An appeal for audience members was made on social media, with the recorded programme due to be broadcast on YouTube.
Guests on the pilot show included actor and comedian Omid Djalili, who has become a keen advocate of Ipswich's creative scene since moving to the town four years ago.
Also appearing was Kaine Stromberg, a transformational mindset mentor, and musician Native James, who is nominated for a Mobo award in the Best Alternative Music Act category, with the winners due to be announced at a ceremony in Newcastle upon Tyne on 18 February.
Adams explained his philosophy was ""build it and they will come"". 
""And star power appeared and so we were like, 'wow, this is fantastic' and I loved the fact that they were very open in speaking about their mental journey,"" he said.
Sarah Tieck, from media company This Is Ipswich which makes videos on life in Ipswich, said she wanted to support work to help men deal with issues such as mental health and domestic violence.
 ""I have experienced first hand how important safe spaces for young men are,"" she said. 
""I want to showcase spots in Ipswich where young men can feel heard and learn how to communicate.""
Glen Chisholm, a former Labour councillor and Mayor of Ipswich, was in the audience and said: ""I was really impressed with the event and it made excellent use of a space which was sitting empty.
""Great to see young local talent perform and be involved, and the conversations were very powerful, thought provoking and relevant.""

The Lucy Letby case is the lead on most of the front pages. 
""Baby killer ... or victim?"" is the question posed by the Daily Mirror. It says a ""bombshell new dossier"" has been put forward by medical experts on behalf of the jailed nurse. 
The Daily Telegraph says there are growing calls for a retrial after an ""unprecedented intervention into the conviction of a serial killer"" by 14 world-leading specialists.
The Daily Express says the former nurse has been given ""hope"" that she will be freed from prison.
But the Daily Mail features an interview with a ""distraught mother"", saying she has hit back at the ""upsetting"" and ""disrespectful"" attempts to free Letby. 
The mother of a baby boy - whom Letby was convicted of attempting to murder - tells the paper that Tuesday's news conference was a ""publicity stunt"".
""NHS allowed Nottingham killer to skip medication"" is the headline on the front of the Times. 
It leads on the independent review into the treatment of Valdo Calocane - who has paranoid schizophrenia - before he stabbed to death three people. 
The paper says Calocane was described as ""personable and kind"" by mental health workers, before he was discharged despite a history of violence and a refusal to take medication.
According to the Financial Times, China is seeking ""ammunition"" for talks on tariffs with President Trump - by reviving anti-trust investigations into the American Big Tech companies, Google and Nvidia. 
Beijing is also considering a new probe against Intel, as it looks for leverage with Trump, according to the paper. The FT says US tech companies are being caught in the crossfire of growing tensions between China and the US.
Finally, you have no doubt been told at some point that ""things will feel better in the morning"". Now scientists say there may be some truth to that, according to the papers. 
A large study by University College London has found that people are generally at their best in the morning because the hormone cortisol - which regulates mood and motivation - peaks shortly after waking.

A previous charge of encouraging or assisting murder was discontinued by prosecutors.
Two police officers were injured as they formed a wall of bodies and police vans to stop the rival groups meeting, a court previously heard.
Hepburn was also ordered to undergo mental health treatment for 12 months, carry out a two-week rehabilitation activity and pay a £200 fine.

The item went under the hammer at NLB Auctions in Paignton on Saturday with bidders in the room, on the phone and online.
Daniel Pearce, who runs the auction house, found it among the possessions of a deceased man from Brixham that had been earmarked for the bin. 
He said the price was ""an absolutely great result for a first edition hardback.""
He said the book was from the first print run of 500 copies and was among the 300 distributed to public libraries. 
The misspelling of 'philosopher's' on the back of the copy was among the things that helped Mr Pearce identify it as a first edition.
""It is missing the o at the end,"" he said.
The auction house scheduled the lot for about 16:00 GMT to accommodate the time difference for interested parties on the west coast of the USA.
Mr Pearce said: ""It's made its way overseas and it's a really good result.

Essex Police and the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation after being made aware of emails ""implying a threat"" to several schools, including in Essex and Hackney, east London.
The forces assessed the digital communications but did not believe they posed a credible threat to the schools that received them. 
Staffordshire Police has now arrested a 21-year-old man on suspicion of sending communication of an indecent or offensive nature.
The BBC understands some of the schools affected included White Hall Academy in Clacton, Clacton Coastal Academy, and Sir Martin Frobisher Academy, in nearby Jaywick.
In a message sent to parents by Clacton Coastal Academy, however, school bosses said, while they had been ""made aware"" of the threats, they had not received an email.
But, after consulting police, the ""sensible precaution"" to put a partial lockdown in place was taken.
Pupils were prevented from moving around parts of the site and extra staff members were deployed to entrance points.
""We were in close contact with parents, making them aware of the situation and updating them as soon as the police had confirmed the threat was not credible,"" a school spokesperson said.
Earlier reports circulating online had suggested a man had been spotted on the roof of one of the schools, but this turned out to be a caretaker checking tiles.
Police forces were first alerted to reports of threats being made to a number of schools in Hackney and Essex at about 08:30 GMT on Tuesday. 
Met officers searched the school in Hackney that reported the threats, but nothing suspicious was found.
Essex officers were also deployed and offered ""reassurance"" at the schools affected throughout the day.
The Met said it was continuing to investigate and a spokesperson added: ""Our priority is the safety of pupils and staff and, alongside other forces, we are working with the schools affected to offer reassurance.""

The decision to abandon the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) recruitment targets comes after the company carried out an annual review of its corporate policies.
The technology giant is also reviewing some of its other DEI programmes.
US President Donald Trump and his allies have regularly attacked DEI policies. Since his return to the White House just over two weeks ago, Trump has ordered government agencies to eliminate such initiatives.
""We're committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities,"" a Google spokesperson said.
""We've updated our [annual investor report] language to reflect this, and as a federal contractor our teams are also evaluating changes required following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic.""
The story was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
Between 2021 and 2024, Google's investor reports stated its commitment to make ""diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do"". That line is not in its latest report, which was published on Wednesday.
In recent years, Google had been an outspoken supporter of DEI targets, particularly after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and the protests that followed his death.
At the time, Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, set a five-year goal to increase the number of its leaders who came from underrepresented groups by 30%.
According to the company, the proportion of black people among its leadership almost doubled between 2020 and last year. It also said representation of women and Latino people had increased in those roles.
Google is the latest major company to make a U-turn on its diversity policies.
Meta, Amazon, Pepsi, McDonald's, Walmart and others have rolled back their DEI programmes.
Apple has stood out by pushing back against this trend. Last month, the tech giant's board asked investors to vote against a proposal to end its diversity policies.
The proposal by conservative group, the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), called on the iPhone maker to abolish its DEI policies, saying they expose firms to ""litigation, reputational and financial risks"".
Last week, the retail chain Target was sued by a group of shareholders, led by the City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund in Florida, who said the firm had defrauded them by allegedly concealing the risks associated with its DEI policies.
The lawsuit referred to a 2023 backlash over LGBTQ+ merchandise at its stores, which caused both its sales and its stock price to drop.
Target has also recently announced that it was ending its DEI targets.
In the latest example of the Trump administration's disapproval of such policies, the US President last week speculated, without giving evidence, that DEI had led to an air crash in Washington DC.
The remarks, which came less than 24 hours after the crash, were in line with the White House's efforts to undo such programmes.

She was sacked after a panel found her claim that an animal ran into the police car's path in Eton Wick Road was a lie.
In February 2024, she admitted careless driving, got five penalty points on her licence and was told to pay a £266 fine, £90 costs and a £106 victim surcharge by magistrates.
Morris, who was previously based in Slough, was in the car with another officer but neither suffered any lasting injuries.
She suffered minor head injuries and a back injury, which required a short course of physiotherapy, TVP said.
The panel said Morris' lie was an example of ""operational dishonesty"".
It said it ""regretted"" she would be sacked but it was the least serious outcome it could pass given TVP's misconduct rules.

The A436 will be closed between the Air Balloon and Seven Springs roundabouts for two nights this week, resulting in a 12-mile diversion for drivers. 
The two-mile stretch will be closed between 21:00 GMT on Thursday and 06:00 on Friday and again from 21:00 on Friday to 06:00 on Saturday.
The work is linked to the £460m 'Missing Link' project, which will connect traffic from the M4 to the M5.
During the closures, diversion routes will be in place via the A46, A40, A435, A436.
A spokesperson for National Highways said it made the decision to bring work to install permanent drains in the area forward to prevent flooding following recent wet weather.
It apologised for the short notice of the closure and said it had taken measures to reduce disruption ""where possible"".
""Signposted diversion routes will be in place during the closure and access for residents and emergency services will be fully maintained during the closures,"" the spokesperson added.
Drivers are being encouraged to follow official diversion routes instead of sat-navs.

Hundreds of prisoners broke out of Munzenze prison last Monday, after fighters from the M23 rebel group began to take over the city.
Between 165 and 167 women were assaulted by male inmates during the jailbreak, an internal UN document seen by the BBC says.
The report states that most of the women were killed after the inmates set fire to the prison.
The BBC has not been able to verify the reports.
Goma, a major city of more than a million people, was captured after the Rwanda-backed M23 executed a rapid advance through eastern DR Congo.
The city was plunged into chaos, with bodies lying in the streets and missiles reportedly flying over residential homes.
Footage from last week's jailbreak showed people fleeing from the building as smoke rose in the background. Heavy gunfire could also be heard.
In a separate video, people believed to be the escaped prisoners, filed through Goma's streets.
The UN says at least 2,900 people were killed during the fighting, with 2,000 bodies buried and another 900 still in the city's morgues.
Earlier this week, the rebels announced a ceasefire on humanitarian grounds.
However, the M23 launched a new offensive on Wednesday, sources say, reportedly capturing the mining town of Nyabibwe.
Nyabibwe is about 100 km (60 miles) from Bukavu - the east's second-largest city,  and the reported target of the rebels' most recent advance.
The Congolese authorities have enlisted hundreds of civilian volunteers to help defend Bukavu.
Meanwhile, Malawi has announced it will start preparations for a withdrawal of its peacekeeping forces from the country. This follows the  killing of three of its soldiers in the fighting around Goma.
They were part of a southern African force, led by South Africa. Although 14 South Africans have been killed, President Cyril Ramaphosa has vowed to keep his forces in the country.
Back in Goma, where residents are adapting to life under the M23, there are fears of a cholera outbreak.
Stephan Goetghbuer, a regional lead from the charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said: ""Access to water has been cut for days, corpses have been lying in the streets and waterborne diseases such as cholera are a real threat. 
""Some of our cholera treatment centres are full and have been expanded.""

Oxfordshire County Council's Trading Standards carried out raids at off-licences, convenience stores, food retailers and barbers in Banbury, Kidlington and Oxford.
Specialist tobacco detection dogs - which were used to sniff out contraband in concealments within till points or hidden in storerooms -  assisted the operation.
Alongside the cigarettes, teams also seized counterfeit hand-rolling tobacco, nicotine pouches and vapes.
The raids, carried out last month, were part of Operation CeCe - a national initiative to tackle the sale and supply of illegal tobacco products.
Councillor Dr Nathan Ley, Oxfordshire County Council's public health chief, said its officers would ""continue to crack down"" on the sale of illegal products and ""cause the maximum disruption possible to criminal networks"".
""People can help us to stamp out illegal tobacco and create a healthier and safer county by being vigilant and reporting any suspicious activity using the illegal tobacco hotline,"" he added.
In total, tobacco products with a street value of more than £5,000 were seized during the operation.
That included 9,340 illegal cigarettes, 700g of counterfeit hand-rolling tobacco, 180 packs of non-compliant nicotine pouches and 42 disposable vapes, with a capacity of nicotine containing liquid nine times the maximum allowed.
Jody Kerman, the council's head of Trading Standards, said: ""We are serious about taking action whenever we find anyone selling illegal tobacco.""

Norwich Jazz Festival, which first ran more than 40 years ago, has curated artists from around the world to perform in venues across the city.
Headline acts include Brazilian jazz-funk legends Azymuth and Norwich-based trio Mammal Hands, who will perform alongside a number of UK rising stars.
Bradley Glasspoole, the festival programmer, described how the event had been  designed to showcase the ""many facets"" of jazz, in a way that was accessible to young people and families.
He said: ""For some people, 'jazz' might be not for them because they might think it's too middle class or they might think they don't understand it and so forth, but this is very accessible.""
To encourage a younger audience to attend, people aged 25 and under will be able to purchase tickets to some performances at a reduced rate. 
One of which will be a show by the National Youth Jazz Orchestra, whose alumni include Amy Winehouse and Mark Armstrong. 
Norwich first became home to the jazz festival in 1981, with events held intermittently until 2005. 
Gigs will be held in a range of venues across Norwich, including Norwich Arts Centre, Epic Studios and Cinema City.
Artists will take to the stage on Thursday, 15 May, with the festival drawing to a close on Saturday, 24 May.
Additional acts are expected to be announced as part of the line-up in the coming weeks.

A call for help was made to restore the Peterborough Arch at Thorpe Meadows when a condition inspection in 2022 showed the sculpture had extensive damage.
The 4m (13ft) high artwork, carved from iroko wood, had to be removed for safety reasons. 
Restoration costs will total £50,000, but grants to the Nene Park Trust from the Henry Moore Foundation and The National Lottery Heritage Fund meant only an  additional £3,000 needed to be raised.
The Save Peterborough Arch fund reached its appeal target after it received a £1,000 donation last week. 
The money will go towards restoration works, as well the maintenance and development of the city's entire Sculpture Collection.
Sharing the news on Facebook, a spokesperson from the trust said: ""Restoration work will begin this month and we hope to see this very special Peterborough landmark back in its rightful place, overlooking Longthorpe Parkway very soon.""
The Arch was commissioned by the Peterborough Development Corporation in the 1980s and created by artist Lee Grandjean.
Mr Grandjean, who was deputy head of sculpture at London's Royal College of Art, chose the site to align the sculpture with the city centre and the cathedral.
Matthew Bradbury, chief executive of the trust, previously described the Nene Park Trust ""as guardians of the Peterborough Sculpture Collection"".
He added it had ""an important role to play in restoring and preserving our city's cultural heritage for future generations"".

The research comes after the death of a Colchester woman in a bedroom fire on 14 January.
Essex County Fire and Rescue Service (ECFRS) offers free home safety checks and installs smoke alarms for those who need them.
Claire Monk, the ECFRS Live Safe manager, said: ""Sadly, the statistics speak for themselves. People who live alone are more likely to be victims of fire, and less likely to have working smoke alarms at home.""
Residents can refer a neighbour for a free home visit through the ECFRS website, if you have concerns about their fire safety.
The service suggests keeping an eye out for fire hazards ""like unattended candles or portable heaters placed too close to furniture"".
Ms Monk continued: ""Each year, we visit thousands of homes in Essex to help people stay safe and we need your help to make sure we're reaching the people who need our help the most.
""We're particularly looking to book visits in with people who are elderly and live alone or would struggle to get out quickly in the event of a fire or other emergency.
""If you hear a smoke alarm or see smoke coming from a neighbour's house, do not hesitate to dial 999 immediately. Your awareness can save the lives of others,"" she added.
ECFRS suggests residents test their neighbour's smoke alarms and contact the fire service if a new one needs fitting.

Pictures and videos show the intensely coloured water flowing into an estuary, the Rio de la Plata, which borders an ecological reserve.
Local media reports suggest the colour may have been caused by the dumping of textile dye, or by chemical waste from a nearby depot.
The Environment Ministry said in a statement that water samples had been taken from the Sarandí canal to determine the cause of the colour change.
By late afternoon the colour of the water had lost some of its intensity, the AFP news agency reported.
Residents have claimed that many local companies dispose of toxic waste in the waterway, which runs through an area of leather processing and textile factories some 10km (6 miles) from the centre of the capital.
A resident, a woman called Silvia, told local news channel C5N that although it is has turned red now, ""other times it was yellow, with an acidic smell that makes us sick even in the throat"".
""I live a block from the stream. Today, it has no smell. There are not many factories in the area, although there are warehouses.""
Another resident, Maria Ducomls, told AFP industries in the region dump waste in the water, and said she had seen it coloured differently in the past - ""bluish, a little green, pink, a little lilac, with grease on top"".

The decision on the Rampion 2 project was due by Thursday, but the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has pushed back the deadline to 4 April as it wants more information from the applicant in regards to piling restrictions.
The project from Rampion Extension Development Limited would see the existing site of 116 turbines off the West Sussex coast expanded by up to 90 turbines. 
A project spokesperson said the Secretary of State had requested the information by 20 February and that deadline extensions were not uncommon.
When public hearings began on the plans, critics voiced concerns about the wind farm's impact on tourism.
But operator RWE Renewables said the expansion of the existing windfarm, which opened in 2018, could generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of more than one million homes.
If approved, construction is expected to start in 2027 and be completed by 2030.
The expansion could be constructed between 13km (8.1 miles) and 26km (16.2 miles) from the coast.
The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has been contacted for a comment.

Peterborough City Council hopes the permits at the Fengate Household Recycling Centre could reduce the amount of visitors to the facility who do not live in the city. 
The scheme aims to lower waste, reduce costs to Peterborough taxpayers and reduce congestion during peak times.
Site users who visit the centre in a vehicle will need to have an e-permit from 24 February.
In September last year, the council proposed introducing a residents-only permit at the site to help save about £63,000 in the year to April 2026.
In a report, the authority said staff were aware people from Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire had used the site due to ""restricted opening hours"" at their local centres.
Peterborough City Council's cabinet member for environment and transport, Angus Ellis, said: ""It is a real asset for the council and Peterborough residents, providing a modern one-stop-shop facility which continues to receive positive feedback from users.
""However, this has meant that it often attracts visitors from outside of the city, which can result in it becoming very busy at peak times. 
""It's also unfair for local tax-payers to fund usage by non-Peterborough residents. We are fully committed to ensuring that it runs effectively and the new e-permits will help us achieve this.""
The council has previously operated a van or trailer e-permit scheme, which has been extended to all those visiting by motor vehicle.

Engineering company Sandvik, which owns two-thirds of the site on Torrington Avenue, Tile Hill, is aiming to purchase the rest of the land from Coventry City Council.
The company closed the factory, which produced specialised tools at the site, in 2023 after moving the operation to its native Sweden. 
According to council papers, a condition on the sale will mean the land cannot be developed into homes. 
Documents do not reveal how much the council would get from selling the land or its current rental income, but the decision is listed as having ""financial implications of over £1m"".
A report by a senior council officer said the best option would be to allow the sale to Sandvik. 
He claimed the factory site would need to be redeveloped due to its ageing buildings, and experts believe development would be ""much more challenging"" if there was a mix of ownership.
Cabinet member Jim O'Boyle, who heads up jobs and regeneration at the council, is expected to sign off on the plans next week. 
If it is approved, the site could be sold within 10 working days of the ruling.

The council said it hoped to enhance the coverage provided by cameras to make the town safer for residents, businesses and visitors.
The project will see up to 20 cameras revamped and new cameras installed at additional locations, including High Street, Old Road, Wellesley Road, opposite Orwell Road in Marine Parade East, and the car park and skate park at Clacton Leisure Centre.
A further planning decision on two cameras on the seafront is due shortly.
Labour councillor Peter Kotz, TDC cabinet member for community safety, welcomed the decision and said ""significant strides"" has been made in reducing crime already but more work was needed to be done.  
""This initiative to upgrade CCTV cameras in Clacton is vital to ensure people feel safe in our town centre while also helping to deter crime and catch criminals,"" he said. 
Work is expected to start at various sites by the end of the month, pending consent from Essex Highways, said the council.

Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner announced Sussex has been included in the six areas accepted into the devolution priority programme (DPP) and will move towards electing its first mayor in May 2026.
The leaders of East Sussex, West Sussex, and Brighton & Hove councils said it was ""excellent"", ""historic"" and ""exciting"" news for Sussex.
But there has been opposition from some borough and district council leaders to elections being postponed.
Sussex will now move towards having an elected mayor in March 2026 and reorganise existing councils into three unitary authorities.
Councillor Keith Glazier, leader of East Sussex County Council, said: ""I believe this is excellent news for the people of Sussex because it's an opportunity for more decisions to be made locally and for greater investment here.""
Councillor Bella Sankey, leader of Brighton & Hove City Council, said she was ""optimistic and ambitious"" about devolution.
""It will mean that more money is directly invested in our area and that better transport, affordable housing and skills and job creation can be accelerated,"" she added.
While Councillor Paul Marshall, leader of West Sussex County Council, said: ""A mayoral authority will give our communities greater influence in the big decisions that affect the region, such as our highways, housing, and economic growth, plus much-needed long-term financial stability.""
Rayner, who is also the Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary, agreed to cancel elections in May because she said the government was ""not in the business of holding elections to bodies that won't exist"".
The Green Party and Liberal Democrat leaders of four out of five of the East Sussex borough and district councils had written to the government to object to elections being postponed.
Following the announcement, Councillor Zoe Nicholson, Green Party leader of Lewes District Council, said she was ""deeply disappointed"".
She added: ""The Government has rejected our calls to protect the democratic rights of East Sussex residents and instead is favouring propping up an administration which has been a minority administration for the last 18 months, and will hang on to power completely unnecessarily for probably the next two years, maybe three.""
A devolution consultation will now be held before the end of March 2025.
The results will be assessed in the spring and a ministerial decision will be taken as to whether to proceed with a mayoral strategic authority prior to unitary re-organisation.

Peterborough City Council hopes the permits at the Fengate Household Recycling Centre could reduce the amount of visitors to the facility who do not live in the city. 
The scheme aims to lower waste, reduce costs to Peterborough taxpayers and reduce congestion during peak times.
Site users who visit the centre in a vehicle will need to have an e-permit from 24 February.
In September last year, the council proposed introducing a residents-only permit at the site to help save about £63,000 in the year to April 2026.
In a report, the authority said staff were aware people from Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire had used the site due to ""restricted opening hours"" at their local centres.
Peterborough City Council's cabinet member for environment and transport, Angus Ellis, said: ""It is a real asset for the council and Peterborough residents, providing a modern one-stop-shop facility which continues to receive positive feedback from users.
""However, this has meant that it often attracts visitors from outside of the city, which can result in it becoming very busy at peak times. 
""It's also unfair for local tax-payers to fund usage by non-Peterborough residents. We are fully committed to ensuring that it runs effectively and the new e-permits will help us achieve this.""
The council has previously operated a van or trailer e-permit scheme, which has been extended to all those visiting by motor vehicle.
Residents who have a valid van or trailer e-permit already can continue to do so, but if they decide to visit by car, they will need a separate e-permit.

Zaheer Abbas, 45, of Weldale Street, Reading, was convicted at St Albans Crown Court after it was discovered he assisted and encouraged Husnein Amjad, 25, to kill his own father - Amjad Hussain - in Watford in October 2021.
Mr Hussain, 52, was found with serious injuries inside an upstairs bedroom by family members in Fuller Road after rumours he had married a woman in Pakistan.
Following further investigations Abbas was arrested and charged in June 2024 after it was discovered ""he had groomed and manipulated his cousin Amjad into killing Mr Hussain"". He is due to be sentenced on 11 April.
An earlier trial heard how Mr Hussain suffered an hour-long assault with a belt, kicks and punches, which were recorded on Amjad's phone. 
The cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head, chest and abdomen. 
Amjad was sentenced to life, in December 2023, and told he must serve a minimum of 17 years in jail. 
In a statement, released by police, Mr Amjad's family said he was a much loved ""father and husband"" and his loss has ""has left a wound that will stay with us our whole lives"".
""Due to Zaheer's direct responsibility and involvement we have lost our father forever and to some extent our brother/son too.
""We urge families to keep a close eye on their young ones and those who they spend their time with.

A BBC investigation found 27 sites in England, including in Kidsgrove, Rugeley and Stoke-on-Trent, were sold over the past 14 years for a total of £12.2m.
Former mining communities said they wanted the money from the sales to be reinvested in their local areas.
However the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation (CISWO) said it ""cannot ring-fence funds for specific use in only one area"".
The CISWO was created under the Miners' Welfare Act 1952 to support miners, their families and coalfield areas.
A spokesperson for the charity added it ""carries out enormous good works"" and had supported more than 130,000 miners or family members over the past 14 years, with more than £8m in grants.
It said many of the sites were closed for years beforehand and it does not keep all of the money from a sale as it has to pay costs such as debts owed by sites' trustees
The sites that were sold in Staffordshire include the Chatterley Whitfield sports ground in Stoke-on-Trent which sold for £2.5m in 2021 and the Pear Tree Youth Centre in Rugeley which sold for £500,000 in 2020.
Both sites became housing estates, the BBC investigation found.
Elsewhere, former tennis courts at Lea Hall Miners Welfare Centre in Rugeley were sold for £393,176 and also turned into housing.
Kidsgrove Central Youth & Community Centre, part of a British Coal transfer in the 1990s, was sold for £225,000 in 2020.
The CISWO, which supports former mining communities across the UK, said it had spent £58.8m over the past 14 years.
The charity added it was legally obligated to permanently keep some money on its balance sheet which it used to invest and generate income to be spent in local communities.
In response to its public accounts showing a reduction in the number of personal welfare payments, services and grants schemes, it said it had seen costs rise and fewer people seeking support. 
The group said it had ""broadened"" its support for communities, which ""changes and evolves as individuals age and needs grow"".

95,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3jxj4z8qgo,2025-02-08,Council burns recyclable material amid bin strike,"Birmingham City Council has admitted it is incinerating some of the recycling rubbish collected from residents during the ongoing bin strike.
There are fears of city-wide disruption after the union Unite said members would step up their industrial action and walk out for 12 days this month and 13 days in March.
The council confirmed this week that recycling collections had now been suspended.
Residents have been told to take their paper, glass, plastic and tin to a tip instead.
""The council is making every effort to make sure waste collection services continue during this period of industrial action,"" a spokesperson for the council said.
The authority would, they added, try to recover recyclable materials via a treatment process when general waste was collected. 
The council said if this was not possible, material would be used as a fuel source to generate electricity, with ""thermal"" treatment at its Tyseley incinerator able to produce power for up to 60,000 homes.
BBC analysis from October found that burning rubbish in incinerators to make electricity was the dirtiest way the UK generates power, with scientists warning of a ""disaster for the climate"".
The BBC examined five years of data from across the country, and found that burning waste produces the same amount of greenhouse gases for each unit of energy as coal power, which was abandoned by the UK last year.
Veolia, which operates the Energy Recovery Facility in Tyseley, says it is built to comply with strict European emissions standards that came into force in 1996.
The news that recycling collections had been suspended came as the cash-strapped council revealed a planned 7.5% council tax rise in the new financial year, on top of the near 10% rise imposed last April.
Unite says members are striking over the council's decision to abolish the Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) role - a position it describes as ""safety critical"".
The city council has insisted its planned changes would improve the quality of service delivery and safety.
In a statement, it previously said: ""We are disappointed this action is taking place, but we are continuing to work through the dispute resolution procedure.
""We would like to assure residents that we will do all we can to minimise disruption during any potential industrial action.""

Cambridgeshire Police said a 30-year-old from Essex was arrested on Wednesday and is in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station in Peterborough. 
The force has been investigating multiple complaints of hare coursing, criminal damage and dangerous driving after incidents took place in nine areas of Cambridgeshire on Saturday, 25 January. 
In their efforts, police have seized four vehicles in Grantham in Lincolnshire and Essex, alongside hare coursing equipment. 
A local councillor described the incident as putting lives at risk, while farmers have been dealing with damage to their fields.
On Tuesday, police made three arrests including two men from Essex aged 22 and 51, and a 46-year-old man from Solihull was detained in Peterborough. 
Last week, an 18-year-old man from Spalding and a 26-year-old man from Grantham were arrested.
The five men were all released on bail and must return to Thorpe Wood Police Station at a later date. 
Their bail conditions include that they ""must not shout at, swear at, or intimidate any persons"" in 12 counties in the East of England and the East Midlands.

Roccio Cifuentes, Children's Commissioner for Wales, was speaking after a 14-year-old girl was convicted of the attempted murder of three people during a school stabbing in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, last April.
Ms Cifuentes said she agreed with the chief inspector of the Welsh education watchdog, Estyn, about not having a blanket exclusion policy.
""Schools have to be a safe space for everyone, pupils and teachers alike,"" Ms Cifuentes said. 
The incident has prompted others to suggest schools should consider searching pupils and employing security guards.
Ms Cifuentes said the Ammanford case was ""sad and shocking... and thankfully very rare"".
""I overall agree with what the chief inspector for schools has said, about this being a nuanced and complex issue,"" she told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement. 
""We can't turn schools into a battleground,"" she said, adding that teachers and children are ""under significant pressure"". 
""Maybe they are feeling under pressure to, on occasion, take weapons into schools. We need to start with understanding and talking.""
Ms Cifuentes said she would not like to see a ""punitive or highly securitised approach"" in schools.
""I think that would be very detrimental to children and young people and their wellbeing.""
Ms Cifuentes also said the ongoing debate about the use of phones in schools was an issue she was aware of but that a ""whole society approach"" was needed.
A new report by the University of Birmingham suggested that a ban made very little difference in improving grades or mental wellbeing.
But it did suggest spending longer on phones and social media in general was linked to lower grades, poor sleep, disruptive behaviour and a lack of exercise.
""This is not just about what happens in schools,"" said Ms Cifuentes.
""We have new rules coming in to place, through the Online Safety Act, which will place greater responsibility on social media companies to keep children more safe online, and parents and families have a role to play.
""We need not only to potentially restrict the use of phones, but also need to offer young people real alternatives and we need to be talking to children more as well.""

The barrister will serve as a visiting professor of practice in international law at the Blavatnik School of Government.
Ms Clooney, who read law at St Hugh's College, said: ""I am honoured to be back at Oxford, this time not as a student but as a professor.""
The school says its aims are to train future world leaders and support better government and public policy around the world.
Ms Clooney added: ""It is a privilege to have this opportunity to engage with the next generation of global leaders and to contribute to the vibrant academic community at Oxford. 
""I look forward to collaborating with both faculty and students to advance access to justice around the world.""
Ngaire Woods, dean of the Blavatnik School, said she was ""delighted"" to welcome Ms Clooney as a visiting professor.
""As a pre-eminent practitioner and scholar, Amal's expertise and insights will greatly enhance the school's research and teaching,"" she said.
British-Lebanese barrister Amal Clooney is known for taking on high-profile human rights cases.
She was part of the legal team working towards the release of Al Jazeera journalists jailed in Egypt, and represented Nadia Murad, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who was captured and tortured by the group calling itself Islamic State.
She founded the Clooney Foundation for Justice with husband George Clooney, which provides free legal aid in defence of free speech and women's rights around the world.
Ms Clooney was formerly a visiting professor at Columbia Law School, and published textbooks on international law. 
Oxford University said her award-winning book The Right to a Fair Trial in International Law had been cited in judicial proceedings, including by the UK Supreme Court.

Residents raised concerns about California Cross in Finchampstead, Berkshire, where painted leaf designs were used in place of standard roundabout markings and pedestrian crossings.
Documents showed a road safety audit in January made a number of recommendations to make the junction clearer, including adding central islands to the mini roundabouts.
But designers said they rejected some of the recommendations because there was evidence the junction was ""operating as intended"", although the council added it would continue to monitor it.
Wokingham Borough Council commissioned consulting firm WSP to undertake a Stage 3 Road Safety Audit into the junction, which was completed in September 2024.
The audit made a number of recommendations, including adding ""look both ways"" markings to the crossing points, adding central islands and arrow markings to the roundabouts.
It also suggested adding hatching on to the approach to existing islands to reduce the risk of collisions.
The design team said the markings at the pedestrian crossings could ""give the false impression that drivers have priority over pedestrians"".
Hatching leading up to the existing islands ""could detract from the scheme approach"", designers said, noting the existing arrow on the bollard ""should suffice"".
Other recommendations, including discussing moving signage for the nearby petrol station and trimming vegetation to improve visibility, were accepted.
The council's executive member for highways, Martin Alder, said there was evidence the design of California Cross had slowed motorists down. 
""We set out to create a pleasant, safe environment with a stronger sense of place, while slowing traffic down and making drivers more aware of pedestrians,"" he said.
""All the evidence shows that we are achieving that.""
The council added it had installed cameras in October to monitor how people used the junction, and that it would finish reviewing the footage by the end of February.

""Yarn with Ernie"" depicts the late potter and painter Ernie Childs as if he were in mid-conversation in his beloved Great Yarmouth.
Artist Mark Goldsworthy is due to put the finishing touches to Ernie.
The statue is due to be positioned in the Market Place in the Norfolk town this summer, when nine other sculptures will form a trail leading to the seafront.
''We have an incredibly rich and vibrant range of sculptures that I know people will take to their hearts and that will be a real asset for the borough,"" said borough council leader Carl Smith. 
The artworks ""celebrate the best of Great Yarmouth"", from its role as a circus capital, its maritime and medieval history, through to its embracing of clean energy and transport links, the council said.
Mr Goldsworthy, of Bungay in Suffolk, previously told the BBC the Ernie statue represented the town's characters and historical characteristics.
Childs was born in 1947 in the medieval streets known as The Rows and lived in the town all his life.
He died in 2019, aged 71.
An outdoor circular walking route will take visitors from the Market Place to the seafront, taking in St George's Road and park, Regent Road and Church Plain.
On what is believed be to a UK first, a mosaic will be created on a section of tiled paving outside Christchurch, to reflect the cultural impact of the town's Portuguese community.
The £330,00 project was on track for completion, the council added.
The local authority has submitted a planning application for the sculptures, which is due to be considered at the end of the month.

In April, Bath and North East Somerset Council (BANES)  installed bollards at the junction of Sydney Road and New Sydney Place in Bath.
Residents living on Sydney Road said the scheme ""freed them from the tyranny of the motor vehicle"".
A BANES spokesperson said about quarter of respondents to its survey supported the scheme, with most objections coming from people living outside the trial streets and the wider Bathwick area.
Before the trial began, New Sydney Place saw 4,466 to 4,770 vehicles a day on average, and three quarters of that was through-traffic.
Once the bollards were installed, vehicle numbers were reduced by up to 90% on New Sydney Place and 70% on Sydney Road.
The schemes aimed to cut rat-running along residential roads and to create safer places for cyclists and pedestrians.
Traffic levels were monitored during the trial and the council said that while major routes nearby saw an increase in vehicle numbers, the impact on travel times and queue lengths was ""not significant"".
There was also no negative impact in terms of air pollution as a result of the road closure.
Councillor Mark Elliott, cabinet member for resources, said: ""It is interesting to see from the feedback how people's opinions have shifted over the course of the trial to be more positive, although a significant number are obviously still opposed. 
""The consultation process allowed people to express a wide range of views.

Cambridgeshire's police and crime panel will meet in Peterborough on Wednesday to discuss the potential precept increase, which would take effect in April.
Darryl Preston, the county's PCC, announced plans for the increase in January and began a residents' survey.
The increase would add 27p per week to council tax bills for householders living in a band D property, or £13.95 per year.
A report produced ahead of the meeting said Cambridgeshire Police was the fourth-lowest funded force in the country.
It said the force had identified £5.54m of cost savings for the next financial year, but that the proposed precept would generate an estimated £92.6m.
The report also highlighted a survey carried out with 865 residents, asking for their views on the policing precept.
It found 67% were generally supportive of the increase and 16% were generally unsupportive, with the rest choosing to stay neutral.
Preston said he was ""reluctantly"" proposing the increase when he launched the survey in January.
""Every community deserves a properly funded and well-equipped police force,"" he said.
""In Cambridgeshire, we have made huge strides to adapt and expand our capabilities to improve the way we prevent, solve and investigate crime and this effort needs to be sustained.""

Tandridge District Council leader Catherine Sayer shared her concerns about the ""incredibly tight"" timetable to submit devolution proposals after Wednesday's government announcement.
Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said elections in Surrey would be postponed until 2026 as part of devolution plans in the county.
Other Surrey politicians have also shared their concerns about the plans while another said they would give the county a ""strong national voice on a national level"".
Ms Sayer said: ""I wouldn't want to see the close community connections and accountable local councillors that we have here in Tandridge watered down by creating mega councils where the views and the hopes of local people are drowned out.
""I am concerned that it's rushed and we have to get this right.""
Ms Sayer also reiterated concerns about councils absorbing debt from other local authorities such as Woking Borough Council.
Local elections in Surrey will be moved to 2026 but the county will not be included in mayoral elections planned for next year.
Al Pinkerton, Liberal Democrat MP for Surrey Heath, argued in Parliament that Surrey residents ""face the prospect of not having the advantages of being on the priority programme but also all the disadvantages of losing their elections"".
But Tim Oliver, Conservative Surrey County Council leader, shared his support for the plans, adding they would aid efficiency and ""give us a strong voice on a national level"".
Local Government Secretary Angela Rayner said: ""The reorganisation is about recognising the challenges that Surrey faces, working with local leaders to deliver services to local areas and then we can look at later date if we're able to take (devolution) forward, but we do recognise the unique situation Surrey faces.""

110,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceq9pw9ej0no,2025-02-09,Year-long project to improve footpaths to begin,"A year-long project to enhance public spaces and improve pedestrian routes in a Wiltshire town is set to begin.
Wiltshire Council will start work along The Halve and Roundstone Street in Trowbridge on 10 February.
The council says it wants to improve pedestrian access by adjusting footpath widths, reinforcing routes, and introducing crossings linking to Hilperton Road.
The project will be completed in three phases over 12 months. 
Phase one will run from 10 February to 25 March 2025 at The Halve. Phase two will focus on on Roundstone Street from April to July 2025, with the final phase concluding from October 2025 to March 2026.
Work will take place between 07:00 and 19:00 GMT, Monday to Saturday, with temporary access restrictions possibly affecting residents and businesses, although the council says it will give advance notice.
During phase one, The Halve will be closed from its mini roundabout at Duke Street to Hilperton Road Roundabout, with an outside lane closure at Hilperton Road Roundabout. 
Councillor Tamara Reay, cabinet member for transport, said the council appreciated there would be disruption but emphasised the benefits of the project.
""These improvements align with our priority of fostering well-connected communities, and we're confident they will benefit residents and visitors when complete,"" she said.

A statement on behalf of the building's owner Boss & Co. gunmakers, said they made the decision as part of refurbishment works that were ""essential for the long-term future of the property"".
The goat painting on Kew Green, Kew was the first in an animal-based series of works by Banksy across London last summer.

In a video address on Friday, Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russian army had ""brought back in North Korean soldiers"" who were carrying out ""new assaults"" in the region partially occupied by Ukraine.
He added ""hundreds of Russian and North Korean military"" personnel had been ""destroyed"".  
In January, Western officials told the BBC they believed at least 1,000 of the 11,000 troops sent from North Korea had been killed in the past three months. North Korea and Russia have not commented.
Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The fighting has led to heavy losses on both sides. 
Last week, Ukrainian special forces fighting in Kursk told the BBC they had not seen any North Korean troops there for the past 21 days.
A spokesman said it was probable they had been pulled out after suffering heavy combat losses.
The spokesman added that he was only referring to areas where his forces were fighting, without giving any details about how long that front line was.
Recent reports attributed to South Korean intelligence have suggested the North Koreans soldiers are unprepared for modern warfare, and are especially vulnerable to Ukrainian drones.
Military experts say the reports of North Korean casualties, if they continue at this pace, are unsustainable.
The soldiers were deployed after Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un deepened bilateral ties in recent months, including signing a security and defence treaty.
Pyongyang's assistance to Moscow now also extends to large amounts of ammunition and weapons.
The troops were also seen to have been sent to boost Russia's fighting forces who have seen significant losses.
Russia's military has not publicly revealed its battlefield casualties since September 2022, when it said 5,937 soldiers had been killed.
But Ukraine's president said this week up to 350,000 Russian soldiers had been killed, and other reports suggest that number could be significantly higher.
Zelensky put Ukraine's military casualties at 45,100 - but a number of military experts in both Ukraine and the West believe the losses are much higher.
Ukrainian troops launched a lightning offensive in Kursk six months ago, seizing more than 1,000 sq km (386 sq miles) of Russian territory.
Since then, Russian forces have managed to retake a sizeable chunk of the region.
However, Zelensky on Friday told Reuters news agency that Ukraine had launched a new offensive in Kursk on Thursday, advancing 2.5km (1.5 miles).
Russia's military said the Ukrainian attacks had been repelled. 
The claims by the warring sides have not been independently verified.

The local authority is exploring alternative approaches to economic development through its Community Wealth Building Strategy.
The council has suggested childminding could be widened from care provided in a person's home to include running community holiday clubs in village halls, something which is not currently allowed under Scottish legislation.
It is also looking at the potential of subsidising rural childminders to bring their pay in line with the Living Wage.
In a report, Highland Council said a subsidy would mean childminders no longer having to rely on looking after a minimum number of children to make the job pay.
The Highlands have a large number of rural communities with limited availability of childcare provision to support working families.
Housing and job creation also form parts of the wealth building strategy.
Councillors are due to consider the latest report on the plans at an economy and infrastructure committee meeting on Thursday.
Highland Council has previously warned about depopulation.
Officials said there was a ""significant risk"" parts of the region were being ""drained"" of people.
It said population trends suggested growth around the Inner Moray Firth, but people ""drifting away"" from Caithness and the west Highlands.
The figures showed that between 2003 and 2020 populations increased by 22% in Fortrose and Rosemarkie and 19% in Inverness, but fell by 18% in Mallaig and 17% in Kinlochleven.
Across the region older age groups are growing, partly because of the Highlands' attractiveness as a ""retirement destination"".

Isla, from Aylestone in Leicester, was born with mandibuloacral dysplasia, which makes her bones brittle and causes her to age prematurely.
Mum Stacey says Isla struggles with her mobility, general independence around the house and has difficulty reaching door handles and light switches.
But now all that is to change after the BBC home renovation programme DIY SOS arrived to ""move islands for Isla"" -  equipping the property with everything she needs to make her life more comfortable.
The DIY SOS team said they received more than 1,000 volunteer applications to help renovate Isla's semi-detached home - a near record-breaking figure for the show.
On Wednesday, the team descended on Isla's home with 160 volunteers to start the project.
Speaking to BBC Radio Leicester, her mother Stacey said: ""It already has changed our lives. I have that peace of mind knowing Isla's needs will be met when we go back into that house.""
With their living conditions posing many challenges for the family, Stacey said she had wanted to make changes to the house since Isla was a baby. 
""The only bathroom is upstairs, which can be hard to reach if she's tired, and she struggles to reach door handles and light switches,"" said Stacey. 
The family has asked the DIY SOS team for a downstairs bathroom, lower light switches, lower door handles and extra handrails up the stairs, so Isla can be more independent.
Stacey said she would not have the money or knowledge to do the work herself, ""so these guys are amazing to complete it all in eight days"".
""When we found out it was happening, we all cried with joy,"" said Stacey. 
""A couple of weeks later, the news was posted on social media, and it just blew up.
""The amount of support that was shown to us was so overwhelming, but so beautiful as well.
""With her condition, she is the only person in the world with this mutation, and I think people just see Isla for how special she is and her massive character,"" said Stacey.
Ian Hodgkinson, DIY SOS project manager, said a ""village of people"" were already cracking on with the job. 
""I've been project managing for three years at DIY SOS, and it still never ceases to amaze me; it takes my breath away, to be honest,"" said Mr Hodgkinson.
He said the DIY SOS team completed a month's worth of work in a day.
""We will be moving islands for Isla, there's no doubt about that.
""It's tight, and there's a hell of a lot to do, but we are in it together, and we will overcome adversity.
""Ultimately, it's the only TV show where we can leave a legacy, and I walk away proud as punch, and being involved is an absolute privilege.""
""Our whole lives have been moved to a hotel while this whole exciting thing happens,"" said Stacey. 
Isla has been ""loving"" hotel life, as she is able to have as many pancakes as she likes. 
""I wouldn't be surprised if Isla asked Gabby, the designer, to put a pancake maker in the house when we move back in,"" said Stacey.
In a message to the DIY SOS team, Stacey said: ""Thank you will never be enough for everything everyone is offering and doing for us. 
""Just know that this is changing our lives, and we are beyond appreciative of it.""

The proposed artificial lake - known as the South East Strategic Reservoir (SESRO) - has been met with ""disgust"" by local councillors.
The Oxfordshire branch of Campaign to Protect Rural England has now released a statement raising its concerns about the ""mega reservoir"".
It comes after chancellor Rachel Reeves announced her support for the scheme during a speech in Eynsham last week.
However, campaigners say the proposal would have ""massive environmental and carbon costs"".
In a statement, the local group said: ""Eleven times the size of Farmoor, it would be the biggest reservoir in Europe and its construction would threaten over 200 veteran and ancient trees in the area, along with the wildlife that depend on them.
""It would increase flood risk in the area by raising the groundwater levels by a metre, further exacerbated by the loss of trees and natural landscape.
""We believe the multi billion pound cost of building the reservoir would be more effectively spent by investing in infrastructure, fixing the leaks and upgrading sewage treatment works which is so urgently needed.""
The group has said it will continue calling for a public inquiry and is urging the government to focus on brownfield sites for more affordable housing.
The statement added: ""Rather than ignoring the voices of local communities and bulldozing through major developments, we must consider how we bring people together into the decision-making process to ensure a thriving countryside that benefits everyone.""
The chancellor previously said there would be a public consultation about the reservoir. 
Thames Water announced the reservoir was ""crucial to securing future water supply"" for 15 million customers.
The water firm has said the reservoir is expected to be operational by 2040 and would support Thames Water, Southern Water and Affinity Water in delivering supplies during periods of drought. 
It also said the site would ""help to meet the increasing pressures of climate change and demands of a growing population"" and that it would ""create thriving natural habitats and wetlands, offering recreational opportunities from walking to sailing and fishing"".
A Thames Water spokesperson said the government had approved its Water Resource Management Plan last year after ""extensive public consultation"". 
""We're continuing our community engagement this year and can reassure local residents that the reservoir will not increase flood risks,"" they added.
""We're also working with stakeholders to explore opportunities for enhancing local flood resilience.""

Ministers confirmed the Bridgwater tidal barrier will benefit from £43m funding. 
The barrier, set to be completed in early 2027, will cost about £249m and this latest cash injection is part of that fee.
Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Steve Reed said: ""The storms this winter have devastated lives and livelihoods. The role of any government is to protect its citizens.""
The funding is part of a £2.65bn announcement of investment in flood defences across the UK. 
Reed added the government would continue to invest in building and maintaining flood defences.
Sir Ashley Fox, Conservative MP for Bridgwater, welcomed the funding, calling it ""good news"" after years of planning. 
He said the barrier would ""minimise the risk of flooding"" in Somerset and emphasised that ""once the water is in the bottom of the saucer, it's difficult to get out.""
Fox also noted the economic benefits of the barrier, adding, ""It's jobs for the local area,"" and praised the £43m investment as a positive step forward.
The barrier in Bridgwater will be constructed across the River Parrett between Express Park and Chilton Trinity, and will have two vertical lift gates which can be closed to prevent water from flowing upstream during very high tides in the Bristol Channel.
This, planners say, will help protect 11,300 homes in Bridgwater and neighbouring villages, as well as some 1,500 businesses, from flooding. 
The cost of the whole scheme, including the barrier, the operational site, downstream flood banks at Chilton Trinity, Pawlett and Combwich and 12 upstream sites with improved fish and eel passages, is £249m.
An extra £49m has also been announced in partnership funding.

The proposed artificial lake - known as the South East Strategic Reservoir (SESRO) - has been met with ""disgust"" by local councillors.
The Oxfordshire branch of Campaign to Protect Rural England has now released a statement raising its concerns about the ""mega reservoir"".
It comes after chancellor Rachel Reeves announced her support for the scheme during a speech in Eynsham last week.
However, campaigners say the proposal would have ""massive environmental and carbon costs"".
In a statement, the local group said: ""Eleven times the size of Farmoor, it would be the biggest reservoir in Europe and its construction would threaten over 200 veteran and ancient trees in the area, along with the wildlife that depend on them.
""It would increase flood risk in the area by raising the groundwater levels by a metre, further exacerbated by the loss of trees and natural landscape.
""We believe the multi billion pound cost of building the reservoir would be more effectively spent by investing in infrastructure, fixing the leaks and upgrading sewage treatment works which is so urgently needed.""
The group has said it will continue calling for a public inquiry and is urging the government to focus on brownfield sites for more affordable housing.
The statement added: ""Rather than ignoring the voices of local communities and bulldozing through major developments, we must consider how we bring people together into the decision-making process to ensure a thriving countryside that benefits everyone.""
The chancellor previously said there would be a public consultation about the reservoir. 
Thames Water announced the reservoir was ""crucial to securing future water supply"" for 15 million customers.
The water firm has said the reservoir is expected to be operational by 2040 and would support Thames Water, Southern Water and Affinity Water in delivering supplies during periods of drought. 
It also said the site would ""help to meet the increasing pressures of climate change and demands of a growing population"" and that it would ""create thriving natural habitats and wetlands, offering recreational opportunities from walking to sailing and fishing"".
A Thames Water spokesperson said the government had approved its Water Resource Management Plan last year after ""extensive public consultation"". 
""We're continuing our community engagement this year and can reassure local residents that the reservoir will not increase flood risks,"" they added.
""We're also working with stakeholders to explore opportunities for enhancing local flood resilience.""

129,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly4xwnlze7o,2025-02-05,One of UK's biggest flood defences gets £43m boost,"More than £40m has been announced to protect thousands of homes and businesses in Somerset.
Ministers confirmed the Bridgwater tidal barrier will benefit from £43m funding. 
The barrier, set to be completed in early 2027, will cost about £249m and this latest cash injection is part of that fee.
Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Steve Reed said: ""The storms this winter have devastated lives and livelihoods. The role of any government is to protect its citizens.""
The funding is part of a £2.65bn announcement of investment in flood defences across the UK. 
Reed added the government would continue to invest in building and maintaining flood defences.
Sir Ashley Fox, Conservative MP for Bridgwater, welcomed the funding, calling it ""good news"" after years of planning. 
He said the barrier would ""minimise the risk of flooding"" in Somerset and emphasised that ""once the water is in the bottom of the saucer, it's difficult to get out.""
Fox also noted the economic benefits of the barrier, adding, ""It's jobs for the local area,"" and praised the £43m investment as a positive step forward.
The barrier in Bridgwater will be constructed across the River Parrett between Express Park and Chilton Trinity, and will have two vertical lift gates which can be closed to prevent water from flowing upstream during very high tides in the Bristol Channel.
This, planners say, will help protect 11,300 homes in Bridgwater and neighbouring villages, as well as some 1,500 businesses, from flooding. 
The cost of the whole scheme, including the barrier, the operational site, downstream flood banks at Chilton Trinity, Pawlett and Combwich and 12 upstream sites with improved fish and eel passages, is £249m.
An extra £49m has also been announced in partnership funding.
Alan Lovell, Environment Agency chair, said: ""The impact of flooding on our communities will only become greater as climate change brings more extreme weather, like Storms Bert, Conall and Eowyn.
""With this new funding, we will work closely with the government to deliver the vital projects that are needed across the country, ensuring our investment goes to those communities who need it the most.""

Chief executive Robert Williams thanked and congratulated him, adding that they were ""honoured"" he was still working for the firm.
Looking back on how the industry has changed, Mr Singh said he had always liked interacting with customers.
Reading Buses paid tribute to the long-serving bus driver and released a statement about his career.
Mr Singh first joined the firm as a conductor as he was originally considered too young to drive a bus.
After three years in the role he starting driving, explaining the buses in the 1950s and 60s were ""heavy to drive"" and had ""clunky"" gears.
""Buses are definitely better now, easier to drive and much safer for everyone,"" he said.
""If you broke down you were expected to find a public phone to alert the inspectors - although if you didn't appear after a while, they would send the emergency engineer to find out what had happened.""
Mr Singh said conductor-specific roles started to come to an end in the 1980s and drivers were expected to issue their own tickets. 
He added: ""I actually enjoyed issuing tickets as well as driving, I liked interacting with customers. I don't think others were so keen though.""
Mr Singh also worked as a school bus driver, and said the best piece of career advice he was ever given was to ""leave your worries at work and go home happy"".

133,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvqp81zzdeo,2025-02-09,Lack of child therapy puts strain on parent groups,"A retired GP says parent support groups are having to be created due to a lack of quality therapy services for young people.
Alison Graham, chair and trustee of the Young People's Counselling Service (YPCS), said ""moral and creative"" ideas were needed in response to a lack of funding in the children's mental health sector.  
The group, set up in Yaxley, Peterborough, aims to help parents support their children through advice and shared experiences in a shame free environment. 
Ms Graham said: ""Things are worse now than when I first became a GP 30 years ago and I think that's that's a horrible observation.""
YPCS was set up due to ""very little high quality service for therapy and young people 30 years ago,"" Ms Graham said.
The charity provided free therapy services for children and young people until last year due to a lack of regular outside funding. 
She said while there were some ""amazing individuals doing great work"", the underfunding of mental health services and the way the system was set up was not always fit for purpose.
Ms Graham said: ""As a parent myself... and as a professional I saw firsthand how utterly broken the system is, how inefficient, how underfunded and driven by balancing the books... which is not how you invest in the generation that's coming.
She added: ""My first patient may have been the child, but then the parents become patients because of the stress and their siblings become patients... it has an impact on the wider family.""
The support group began in early September and meets every two weeks on a Wednesday from 18:00 GMT to 20:00.
Ms Graham said some parents would be ""blamed"" for their child's challenging behavior and sent to parenting courses, which were not always useful for parents with neurodivergent children or who had experienced trauma.
She called for more more support groups in the region to give parents a shame-free space to ask for advice from others with lived experience.

In a string of accusations after her departure, Herefordshire group Families Alliance for Change (FAC) criticised Eleanor Brazil's reports and targets and ""unsafe"" services.
Ms Brazil had been appointed Herefordshire's children's commissioner in 2022 after Ofsted rated the county's children's services department inadequate.
Both the BBC and the Local Democracy Reporting Service have approached Ms Brazil for comment.
Herefordshire Council has also been approached but has not yet commented.
In a statement, campaigners said: ""Eleanor Brazil failed to engage meaningfully with parents with poor experiences of children's services.""
The group claimed her reports had ""lacked analysis of the real risks in the system"" and she ""repeatedly set vague targets and spared the leadership of Herefordshire Council from any serious criticism"".
Campaigners claimed ""the service continues to be unsafe and lacking in self-awareness"" and said people who raised complaints were ""still silenced and harassed"".
Ms Brazil, who had been appointed by the government, published her last report in December, when she said there had been ""some positive progress from a very low base, although too little"".
However, she felt there was now ""positive commitment within the political and corporate leadership to delivering better outcomes"", and she said there was no longer a need for both commissioner and improvement advisor roles.
Following her report, council chief executive Paul Walker said it was ""a positive sign"" of progress.
After Ms Brazil's resignation was confirmed, a Herefordshire Council spokeswoman said: ""In her most recent review, Eleanor Brazil made a recommendation to the Department for Education (DfE) that Herefordshire children's services no longer requires the direction of a DfE advisor in addition to a commissioner.
""Herefordshire's children's services improvement programme is now overseen by the DfE-appointed commissioner, Deborah McMillan, who has replaced Ms Brazil.""

Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton first started robotic surgery in 2023 thanks to a Da Vinci robot, allowing surgeons to carry out intricate operations with less invasive surgery. 
Now, a new specialist operating table will save about an hour per day of the team's time.
Tom Edwards, a colorectal surgeon at the hospital, said the new equipment will allow them to ""schedule in more patients for surgery on a single day"" helping to bring down waiting times.
""It's so much better to have the robot paired up with the operating table, as up until now we've been using a standard operating table that wasn't calibrated for the robot.
""While this was perfectly safe, it did mean it was taking a bit too long for us to move things around, as our theatres support colleagues had to undock the robot, and then redock it once we'd moved the patient – it wasn't ideal,"" he said.
Mr Edwards said set up time used to take about 20 minutes for each patient and now estimates the new operating table, which was funded by donations from the Somerset Bowel Cancer Charity, Musgrove Park League of Friends, Love Musgrove and Somerset Unit for Radiotherapy Equipment (SURE), will gain them an extra hour a day.
Richard Bamford, also a colorectal surgeon at Musgrove Park Hospital, said it was ""fantastic"" that the hospital was at ""the cutting edge of surgical technology"" in Somerset.
""Now the robot can be used by our bariatric, upper GI, urology, gynae-oncology, colorectal, and soon to be ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeons too.
""We celebrated our 200th surgery performed by the robot in August 2024 and to get through that many cases across the hospital is fantastic,"" he added.

Dualling of the A350 Chippenham bypass, which connects the south coast with the M4, Bristol and the Midlands, will cost around £32.3m, with £26.6m coming from funding by central government. 
The Department for Transport said, once completed, the changes will shave up to 25% off journey times, reducing air pollution and improving safety.
Councillor Nick Holder, cabinet member for highways at Wiltshire Council, said they would now be able to ""get on with delivering the project"".
Mr Holder said: ""It is important to not just Wiltshire, but also the wider region to move ahead with this project to meet our Business Plan commitment to have well-connected communities.""
""The final phases of dualling the A350 in this area will enhance journey times, increase vehicle capacity and help alleviate congestion, while also improving the Bumpers Farm roundabout to increase traffic flows on their roundabout, particularly in the evenings,"" he added.
The Future of Roads Minister, Lilian Greenwood, said the scheme will boost the economy and improve journeys for locals.
""Drivers on the Chippenham Bypass have experienced unpredictable journey times for too long, which is not good enough for a primary north-south route,"" she said.
Phil Smith, Managing Director, Business West, said the road improvement will help connectivity and create better access to jobs and aid the transport of goods.
The work is expected to start in the spring, with the hope of completing the project in 2026.

The Wiltshire attraction was home to female hippos Sonia and Spot for almost 50 years until their deaths in 2023 and January respectively.
Work to the new hippo house, which will eventually welcome a bull and females, will begin on Monday.
David Leverett, Longleat's Development Director, said the park hoped to welcome hippos back at the site by early summer.
""Our guests will be able to see the largest free-range water habitat in the UK for hippos in human care,"" he said.
""This is the next chapter in the story of hippos at Longleat and is a really exciting time for us as well as ensuring we continue to keep conservation at the forefront of what we do,"" he added.
The planning application, submitted to Wiltshire Council in November, asked for permission to replace the existing structure with a new hippo house as well as make improvements to the grazing paddock and Half Mile Pond by the side of Longleat House.
The plans also feature indoor pools for the hippos and a classroom for educational talks, behind-the-scenes tours and group visits.
""We know how much guests valued being able to see this vulnerable species when Sonia and Spot were here and they have been asking us regularly to bring them back,"" said Mr Leverett.
Simon Askew, Chief Operating Officer, said: ""This will build on our conservation commitments and ensure we are continuing to be at the forefront of breeding vulnerable and rare species.""
The site's sea lions will also be relocated as part of the plans, with the introduction of a new pontoon.

Originally known as the Warren Farm UTC in Kingstanding, it had to move to Erdington when dangerous Raac concrete was found in the roof.
But threats to staff and gang-related conflict there forced the NHS to re-think and it has now moved to Birmingham's Good Hope Hospital.
The health service said it was a temporary relocation until a strategic review of all UTCs across Birmingham and Solihull is completed.

But an NHS report said there were growing safety concerns ""regarding an increase in anti-social behaviour, violence and other serious criminal activity"" at the new site.
It moved on to the Good Hope Hospital on Wednesday and the NHS Birmingham and Solihull Integrated Care Board (ICB) said it would give patients and staff ""better security and more modern facilities"".
Faith Button, Chief Delivery Officer at the ICB, said: ""I want to stress that this is a temporary relocation which has been carried out on an emergency basis and this decision is not one which has been taken lightly.""

Steyn, known for his global success in the insurance industry, died on Tuesday following a long period of poor health.
He was regarded in South Africa as a ""visionary"" and an ""exceptional entrepreneur"".
Steyn first befriend Mandela shortly after the former president was released from his decades-long imprisonment on Robben Island.
Steyn's death was confirmed by Steyn City Properties, the company behind the eponymous luxury golf estate he founded and developed.
The sprawling residential lifestyle estate is located in the northern part of Johannesburg and was designed to ""create a self-sustaining community"", according to South African online news website Daily Maverick.
""It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of the visionary behind Steyn City,"" the company said in a statement.
It added that Steyn would be ""remembered as an exceptional entrepreneur who built a global business of immense scale across seven countries"".
The Nelson Mandela Foundation described the Steyn as a ""larger than life character"" and ""someone Madiba [Mandela] regarded as a friend"". 
After his release from prison in 1990, Mandela spent six months  at Steyn's former home in the affluent Johannesburg suburb, Saxonwold, where he edited his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom.
""He [Steyn] supported Madiba in numerous ways over many years. During 1992 Madiba lived in [Steyn's] home as he navigated his way through a very painful separation from Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.""
South Africa's first democratically elected president also turned to Steyn ""when he needed spaces for retreat or support for his projects"", according to the foundation. 
Mandela spent 27 years in prison for campaigning to end white-minority rule.
Eighteen of those years were spent on Robben Island, an island off Cape Town.
Steyn began his entrepreneurial journey in 1975 when he founded Steyn's Insurance Brokers, according to another local news website BusinessLIVE.
This would pave the way for the establishment of one of the country's leading insurance groups, Auto & General, and later BGL Insurance in the UK in the 1990s. BGL is the parent company of popular price comparison website Compare The Market.
Auto & General was later incorporated into the Telesure Investment Holdings group, which offers a variety of financial service products in countries such as Australia, Turkey and the UK.
Outside his business ventures, Steyn was known for his philanthropy. His family trust donated large sums to South Africa's Covid-19 relief efforts, with a considerable amount going towards supporting small businesses and providing food security for families affected by lockdown.
The Steyn Foundation, established through Steyn City Properties, also supports impoverished townships.
He leaves behind his wife and three children.

Robert Norman, of Drybread Road, Whittlesey, was caught in January 2024 after information led Cambridgeshire Police to seize his phones and a hard drive.
The 41-year-old was also found to have been passing on the details of a girl he thought was aged 10 to other potential offenders.
He admitted a series of sexual offences at Cambridge Crown Court and was sentenced on Friday.
They were three counts of both making indecent images of children and of breaching a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO).
Norman also admitted further offences of breaching notification requirements and attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child.
Police said he had 1,716 indecent images on the seized devices, as well as evidence he was ""speaking sexually"" to a girl he thought was 10.
Officers said he was the subject of a SHPO imposed in 2015 following a conviction for having indecent images of children.
He had not informed officers about one of his mobile phones being capable of accessing the internet, with the device hidden under a pillowcase.
The defendant also used the internet to speak with the girl and deleted the web history from all devices, police said.
In addition, he failed to inform officers of new online usernames.
Det Con Claire Cummings said: ""Norman is a very dangerous, prolific offender.
""He is a complete danger to children as well as the wider community and he has complete disregard for the law.""

The decision report stated that the loss of trees on the site would harm biodiversity and that the application failed to show how it would ""protect or enhance the natural environment.""
While planning permission had already been granted for a smaller development, the additional nine homes were considered unsuitable for the site, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.

150,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0p1ykxyzjo,2025-02-05,Trump sends first migrant detainees to Guantanamo Bay,"The US has sent the first group of migrants to Guantanamo Bay since President Donald Trump announced plans to expand migrant detention at the base, officials say.
A brief statement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the detainees were part of the Tren de Aragua - a gang that originated in Venezuela's prisons.
Ten detainees were flown from the Fort Bliss Army base near the Texas border to the US Navy base in Cuba on Tuesday afternoon, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported, citing multiple US officials.
Last week, Trump ordered that an existing migrant detention facility at the base be expanded to hold some 30,000 people. 
He said that would double the US capacity to hold undocumented migrants.
The move is part of Trump's effort to crack down on undocumented migrants in the US after his return to office. He has promised arrests and mass deportations.
In Tuesday's brief statement, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said: ""President Donald Trump has been very clear: Guantanamo Bay will hold the worst of the worst. That starts today.""
The department published several photographs of the detainees being taken on board the plane. Two officials told CBS that the group was considered ""high-threat"".
Trump ordered that the Tren de Aragua be designated as a foreign terrorist organisation last month, as part of a directive targeting gangs and cartels.
The existing facility - Guantanamo Migrant Operations Center (GMOC) - has been used by both Republican and Democrat administrations to house migrants for decades. It has principally held migrants picked up at sea.
The expanded facility would be run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Trump's border tsar Tom Homan said last week.
Announcing his plan last week that the facility be expanded, Trump said: ""Some of them (the migrants) are so bad we don't even trust the countries to hold them, because we don't want them coming back.
""So we're going to send them to Guantanamo... it's a tough place to get out.""
US military personnel travelled to Guantanamo Bay at the weekend to assemble tents to house migrants sent to the base, the New York Times and CNN reported.
Last year, the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) accused the US government of secretly holding migrants at the base in ""inhumane"" conditions indefinitely.
The administration of Joe Biden, who was then president, responded that the location was ""not a detention facility and none of the migrants there are detained"".
The GMOC is separate to the military prison on Guantanamo which has, for years, held detainees taken into US custody after the 9/11 attacks.
The Cuban government quickly condemned news of the immigration facility's expansion last week, with President Miguel Díaz-Canel calling it ""an act of brutality"".
It has long considered Guantanamo Bay to be ""occupied"" and has denounced the existence of a US naval base on the island ever since Fidel Castro swept to power in 1959.

Suffolk Police said Charlotte Nelson shared sensitive information in a WhatsApp group ""for her own amusement"".
Assistant Chief Constable Nick Davison said she would have been sacked without notice had she not already resigned.
Nelson, from Worlingham near Lowestoft, admitted her actions amounted to gross misconduct and she was truly sorry for how it ""portrayed"" Suffolk Police, the force said.
In his findings, Mr Davison said Nelson's behaviour spanned between January 2022 and August 2023.
She shared details of arrests with friends and associates and used internal police systems ""without a legitimate policing purpose"", he said.
He explained that elements of her offending were targeted at vulnerable members of the public and people who were known to her.
Nelson used her own phone to record bodycam footage showing the ""extremely vulnerable young adult"" being restrained in hospital before sharing it.
""The public has an absolute right to expect officers to treat information in the strictest confidence and use it only for legitimate policing purposes,"" said Mr Davison.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio oversaw the seizure of the plane on Thursday - the second Venezuelan plane the US has confiscated in the Caribbean country in less than a year.
US authorities said there were legal grounds for the seizure, ""based on violations of US sanctions, export controls, and money laundering"". The Venezuelan foreign ministry called Rubio ""an aircraft thief"".
The US has long imposed a variety of sanctions on Venezuela in response to what it describes as criminality, corruption and repression under the South American nation's leader, Nicolás Maduro.
Most recently, it placed financial sanctions on a raft of Venezuelan officials in response to the outcome of a presidential election last year, which saw Maduro re-elected. The US, among others, has contested the official results, which the opposition says were doctored in Maduro's favour.
Rubio, a key figure in the new Trump administration, supervised the confiscation of the Dassault Falcon 200 jet on a visit to a military airstrip in the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo, on the last stop of his Latin American tour.
He told reporters on Thursday: ""The message is that when there are sanctions because they are violating human rights, they are violating a whole series of things, travelling to Iran, helping countries that really wish harm to the United States.
""These sanctions are going to be applied and reinforced.""
Iran and Venezuela remain allies, with Iran's president Masoud Pezeshkian congratulating Maduro on being sworn in for his third term as president last month, saying ""attempts to threaten and sanction Venezuela"" were ""cruel and doomed to failure"".
US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday restoring his ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Iran, which seeks to prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons and restricting it economically through sanctions.
Dominican Republic authorities detained the aircraft last year after the US said it had violated unilateral US sanctions against Venezuela.
Venezuelan officials had used the plane to fly to Greece, Turkey, Russia, Nicaragua and Cuba, and had taken it to the Dominican Republic for maintenance, according to the US state department.
The Venezuelan foreign ministry said it would ""take all necessary actions to denounce this theft and demand the immediate return of its aircraft"".
In September, the US under then-president Joe Biden, seized the first Venezuelan government plane in the Dominican Republic that had been used to transport President Maduro on international trips.

Speaking alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House, Trump said Nippon would instead ""invest heavily"" in the company without taking a majority stake.
The Japanese firm's attempted takeover of Pennsylvania-based US Steel was previously blocked by President Joe Biden on national security grounds.
Union members and Trump had repeatedly criticised such a merger, which would have created one of the biggest steel companies in the world.
No details of the agreement were shared at Friday's bilateral, and Nippon has long stressed its plans to invest in the company. 
Trump - who mistakenly referred to the firm as ""Nissan"" - said he would meet Nippon's head next week to ""mediate and arbitrate"" the deal. 
Facing political pressure, the Biden administration blocked the purchase on the grounds that domestic ownership was important. 
The Japanese government had called Biden's decision ""incomprehensible"" and both Nippon and US Steel ultimately filed a lawsuit.  
More recently, Nippon has argued that the purchase would be ""in line"" with Trump's focus on manufacturing, job creation and promoting investment in the US.
Prime Minister Ishiba was in Washington to cement ties with the country's primary foreign partner.
Both US and Japanese officials said the main purpose of the visit, however, was to forge a personal relationship with Trump - who had a warm relationship with former premier Shinzo Abe during his first term.
The visit marks the first by an Asian leader to the White House since Trump's second administration began in January.
It is the second by a foreign leader during the new administration, following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's trip earlier this week. 
""On television, he is very frightening,"" Ishiba told reporters of Trump at Friday's joint news conference. 
""But when I met with him, he was very sincere. And very powerful. And of very strong will."" 
During Trump's first term from 2017-21, he grew close to Shinzo Abe, bonding over golf. Abe resigned in 2020 and was assassinated two years later.
Japanese officials said Ishiba made ""every possible preparation"" for his meeting with Trump, including seeking advice from Abe's widow - who attended the inauguration as a guest of Melania Trump - and from his predecessor, Fumio Kishida. 
Ishiba also underscored Japan's role as a major economic partner for the US, and highlighted that Japan has been the top foreign investor in the US for five consecutive years.  
Among multinational firms, Japanese companies are the largest job creators in 10 states and the second largest in another six. 
In Kentucky alone, Japanese companies employ more than 45,000 people, primarily in auto equipment manufacturing. 
Earlier in the day, Trump said that while tariffs against Japan could still be possible, he believes the $68bn US trade deficit with Japan can be addressed and would be ""very easy"" for Japan. 
""We have a fantastic relationship,"" he said.  I don't think we'll have any problem. They want fairness also.""
Asked about the possibility of US tariffs - and counter-tariffs - Ishiba declined to provide details. 
""I am unable to respond to a theoretical question,"" he said, eliciting laughs from Trump and journalists in the room. ""That's the official answer we have.""

Daisy the Labrador was abducted from her Norfolk garden in November 2017, sparking press appeals and a petition to government.
An RSPCA inspector found 13-year-old Daisy more than 200 miles away in Somerset on Sunday during a routine investigation, and checked her microchip.
Owner Rita Potter spoke of her joy at getting her dog back, adding: ""We kept a photograph on the mantlepiece and would look at it every day thinking of her, and where she might be.""
Mrs Potter and her husband Philip struggled to hold back tears as Daisy returned to her home in Old Buckenham.
""It is an absolute dream come true that the RSPCA found her and returned her to us - where she belongs - we are so, so grateful,"" said Mrs Potter.
Daisy's theft made news headlines in 2017 after witnesses spotted her being bundled into a truck by suspected 'backyard breeders', who make profit out of breeding animals and have little care for their welfare.
Police investigated but the vehicle could not be traced.
Mr and Mrs Potter took part in several press and social media appeals, with support from actor Tom Hardy who shared their post.
They also started a petition urging the government to do more to tackle pet theft, which attracted 100,000 signatures. Last year the Pet Abduction Bill was passed.
RSPCA inspector Kim Walters rushed Daisy to a vet in Weston-Super-Mare on Sunday, after becoming concerned about her condition.
Her owner - who claimed he had only had the dog for a few years - agreed to sign her over into the care of the animal welfare charity.
A microchip scan revealed she was stolen and gave contact details for Mr and Mrs Potter.
Ms Walters said: ""They were obviously shocked - but elated at the same time.
""I was a bit choked from listening to them, and clearly how much they loved her, so it was great telling them that we could get her back home soon.""
Andy Cook, behavioural welfare adviser for the charity, said: ""It seems Daisy has been used for 'backyard breeding' and she has a number of mammary masses, she has slight hip dysplasia and her coat was quite dirty.
""She really is the sweetest girl and will wag her tail whenever she sees you, but since she was stolen it is clear she has had a hard life.""
Mrs Potter said: ""We know she is elderly now and has health issues, but whatever time she has left she will now be surrounded by lots of love and attention.""

The water company said its teams had prioritised various engineering and green solutions in Fairlight to help reduce the amount of water entering and overloading sewers during and after heavy rainfall.
The sudden increases in flow trigger storm overflows into the environment to prevent homes and communities from flooding, they said.
Sewer sealing is one of the many tactics being utilised as part of the company's £1.5bn investment to solve sewage spills.
As well as sealing the sewers, Southern Water's teams have installed 341 water butts at homes and businesses covering an area of six hectares (60,000 sq m), carried out surveys across a further 5km (3.1 miles) of sewer spines in and around the village and tackled eight private surface water pipes in the Knowle Road area.
Southern Water added that a further 2km (1.24 miles) of sewers could be sealed ""in the coming months"".
Project manager James Latter, said: ""Our work in Fairlight is really starting to make a difference and we're seeing less surface and groundwater able to work into way into our sewers.""
In 2021 the company was fined a record £90m for deliberately dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into the sea.

It followed the deaths of Roman Casselden, 16, and his nine-year-old sister, Darcie, in Pitsea, near Basildon, Essex, on Saturday.
Labour councillor Emma Callaghan said Ashlyns, the road where the siblings were struck by a car, had a series of safety issues, including poor lighting.
She told the BBC that reviews should take place to ensure ""accidents like this won't happen again"".
Police believed Roman and Darcie were riding a privately owned e-scooter when they died.
""[They were] just getting from A to B in an area where they live, an area they know very well,"" said Callaghan, a councillor for Pitsea North West.
""They would've made that journey a million times before and it just took one occasion for everything to change.""
Callaghan started a petition calling on Essex County Council to improve road safety in Ashlyns.
She made a number of recommendations, including: 
The councillor added: ""When things like this happen, you've really got to look at an area and think 'are there enough safety measures in place to ensure accidents like this won't happen again?'.""
An Essex County Council spokesperson, said: ""Since 2005 there has been a 48.2% reduction in people being killed or seriously injured on Essex's roads. 
""The Safer Essex Road Partnership's delivers road safety education, training, publicity and enforcement to reduce fatalities and serious injuries on Essex's roads. 
""This includes visiting schools, running courses and delivering campaigns to raise awareness."" 
Roman and Darcie's mother, Emma, said her children were her ""beautiful angels"" in a tribute shared on Tuesday.
She said Roman had a ""heart of gold"" and Darcie ""was a soul filled with creativity and beauty"".
Speaking previously, Ch Supt Leighton Hammett, of Essex Police, said ""the whole community is mourning"" their loss.
Officers arrested a man and woman, both in their 20s, on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene of an accident in connection with the deaths of Roman and Darcie.
The force said the pair were later released, with a woman bailed and a man released under investigation.

Ellie Humphreys is 24 years old and sober for the first time in eight years after getting help at The Crescent, a supported living service run by charity Framework in Nottingham's Hyson Green.
But next month, the service will close after having its council funding withdrawn - a move Ellie believes will put lives at risk and ""abandon people who urgently need help.""
Nottingham City Council said it would work with those affected to discuss their next steps and direct them to the appropriate services.
The funding cuts are impacting 52 residents across two supported living sites, with Hughendon Lodge in Mapperley also closing its doors on 31 March.
Framework told the BBC it was ""not consulted"" about the council's decision and one resident had been ""held under the Mental Health Act"" after hearing about the development.
For other residents like Ellie, the news has been ""heartbreaking"" and she told the BBC she felt ""terrified"" about her future.
Ellie says she started drinking at the age of 16 as a ""coping mechanism"" but then her addiction spiralled out of control, ruining personal relationships and leading to her couch-surfing for periods of time.
She came to The Crescent a few years ago after her addiction worsened in a previous supported living placement.
The Crescent offers 24-hour care to people with mental health conditions who are at risk of homelessness, and aims to help people live independently.
She said: ""My life before here was really bad. In my last place there was no staff, people got into fights and the police came all the time.
""No-one really checked up on us. I didn't feel safe and my drinking got worse.""
Ellie told the BBC she was in an abusive relationship that contributed to her drinking up to five bottles of vodka per day.
""Because staff weren't there, my ex would sneak in through the back door and let himself into my room. He tried to control what I'd do,"" she said.
""He drank lots. I drank lots. I was constantly in and out of hospital overdosing -sometimes every week. I've lost count.""
Ellie said she had ""given up hope"" by the time she arrived at The Crescent.
""When I first got here, I spent hours crying my eyes out, worrying about where my life would go,"" she said.
""But they got me through - they refused to let my ex inside and I cut him off. They sat with me through my hallucinations when I suffered from withdrawals.
""They helped me get my life back, and I finally felt safe here. Now, I'm scared that I'll relapse.""
Ellie's Mum, Jo Cole, said she had been having ""sleepless nights"" since hearing the news.
""For years, me and Ellie had no relationship. Honestly, I thought I'd get a knock on my door to the news that she's dead"" she said.
""Since coming here, we see each other every week. In the last twelve months she has gone above and beyond and changed. I am so proud of her.
""To hear that Ellie might pick up a bottle again when she's moved...I'm devastated. 
""The council is heading towards a mental health crisis. I fear for Ellie's life, and all the resident's lives."" 
Tom Mole is the manager at The Crescent, and he is now at risk of redundancy along with 11 members of staff based at the site.
""Myself and other staff are worried about how this will impact service users,"" he said.
""We don't know where they will go, putting them at risk of homelessness. It's a short-sighted decision.""
""The team here don't do this for money. We want to help people, and this decision is putting lives in danger.""
The charity's chief executive Andrew Redfern said the funding cut would ""increase the burden on housing, police, employment and other public services.""
""There is a recent history of tragedy in Nottingham, associated with the failure to recognise and manage the risks around severe mental illness, and this seems to have been overlooked,"" he said.
Nottingham City Council said it ""cannot comment on individual cases, and every resident is being offered an assessment to determine their needs"".
It added: ""The decision to terminate the contract was not made on budget cuts. It is common to review contracts if we believe they are no longer delivering the best value, or if residents needs change.""

Jude Harvey, a trainee hairdresser from Southend-on-Sea, died while on holiday in Ibiza in July 2023.
His dad Gary Harvey and stepmother Jude have set up the Jude Harvey Foundation to build awareness, raise funding and offer heart screening to detect cardiac problems.
The sessions for 14 to 35 year olds at Southend Civic Centre in March were already fully booked, Mr Harvey said.
Mr Harvey said the two screenings last year led to 12 referrals and more than 100 people attended each day.
""We know it's never going to bring Jude home, but it's all about awareness, and hopefully those 12 referrals have good outcomes.""
Jo Hudson, from Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY), said the work by Mr Harvey and Jude's stepmother was ""amazing"".
""Like many families we work with, they're seeing past their own grief in order to make sure no other family has to suffer the same experience as them.""
Those who attend the screenings, being held on 15 and 16 March, will be checked with an ECG (electrocardiogram machine), and if an issue is detected they will be offered an echocardiogram to look at the heart and nearby blood vessels.
Mr Harvey said his son was a ""massive personality, the sweetest of souls"".
""It keeps Jude alive for us, because he's got to be,"" he said of the foundation.
""It's too difficult for it not to be. That's my take on grief.""

Freya, whose name has been changed to protect her, found out she had HIV in 2006 and said at first it felt like a ""death sentence"". 
But this has changed over the years and now she wants to urge people to get tested, as she believes ""early diagnosis is key"".
Freya has shared her story after her friend of 20 years, Ascot-based author Nicola May, released her latest book How Do I Tell You?
The book follows the life of 35-year-old Victoria Sharpe, who ""gets devastating news that shatters everything she ever wanted for her future"".
Freya says it took her a while to feel ready for the story to come out, as it includes elements of her journey after diagnosis and the stigma she says she experienced.
Remembering when she was tested for the virus, she said: ""I thought it best to get fully checked as I was entering into a new relationship and wanted to make sure I was perfectly healthy.
""I was so petrified, even the nurses and the doctors, they handled me with thick gloves. I felt originally it was a death sentence.""
Freya was monitored without having to go on medication and says when she told her friend Ms May, they both cried together.
Berkshire-based Ms May says her book is based on a completely fictitious character and there is an emphasis on getting tested early. 
She explains: ""I'm a storyteller by heart, this is a big issue to deal with and I intertwine the romance and story to make it light, but for people to be aware of HIV.
""Originally I was going to call the book Hello I'm Victoria, to have HIV down the front of the page, but my publisher thought that might put people off.""
Freya says the stigma around the virus, which stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus, is still ""rife"".
After finding out she had HIV, Freya says talking to her previous and new partners was the ""hardest thing"", explaining her ""self-esteem became non-existent"".
""I felt very dirty, it only takes one time to get HIV but people will automatically assume you are promiscuous. I had to have some awkward conversations,"" she says.
Talking about the book, Freya says: ""It is not my life story but we have lived this journey together as close friends over 20 years and it is a subject that needs to be talked about, the stigma around it is rife, I am anonymous today for that reason.""
It has been almost 10 years since her diagnosis and Freya says she has come to terms with it and is happy with her partner.
She says: ""Many years ago, a nurse said to me: 'One day, you will wake up and HIV won't be the first thing you think of'.
""I couldn't imagine that day would ever come but he was absolutely right, it did.""

Scientists from the universities of Portsmouth and Southampton discovered the difference in claw size while monitoring ""The Hoff"" crabs.
The species gained its nickname thanks to its hairy chest, prompting comparisons to the Baywatch star.
It lives in large communities around hot vents on the seafloor in Antarctica, with its many hairs hosting bacteria - which the crab feeds on.
The latest study examined 135 of the crabs - part of the Kiwaidae family which are also known as Yeti crabs because of their bristly appearance - at the East Scotia Ridge in the Scotia Sea.
Dr Nicolai Roterman, a deep-sea ecologist from the University of Portsmouth and lead author of the study, said: ""Knowing that there's a difference in size between the male and female claws helps us understand the behaviour and ecology of the yeti crab family - which we know little about because they are a fairly recent discovery, and their home is very difficult to reach.
""Physical differences between males and females is a common feature of decapod crustaceans which live in shallow water, and usually it's because the male is forced to guard the mate, or females have to divert their growth energy for reproduction.""
The team compared The Hoff crab with another yeti crab found off Costa Rica, which does not show difference claw sizes between the sexes.
The difference could be because the Costa Rican crabs use their claws - which are longer and hairier than those of the Hoff crab - mostly for making food rather than fighting, Dr Roterman said.
""We don't yet know if these claw sex differences are the norm for the yeti crab family, or an exception, but the discovery provides a starting point for future research"" he said
Dr Roterman, who coined the Hoff nickname when the species was first discovered in 2010, added: ""Understanding the physiology, behaviour, ecology and evolution of animals adapted to the most extreme conditions give us insights into what evolution is capable of, and therefore how life is likely to adapt to a warming planet and other natural and human-induced ecological stressors.""

171,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yez4qxw26o,2025-02-08,Troubled fire authority launches improvement board,"A fire authority beset with controversy over the past year is to establish a board to improve how it governs the fire service it oversees.
West Midlands Fire and Rescue Authority (WMFRA) said the decision underpinned its commitment to ""strong and effective"" governance of West Midlands Fire Service.
In October, Conervative MP for the West Midlands constituency of Aldridge-Brownhills called for an inquiry into the fire authority, citing ""deep rooted and troubling problems"".
It came just weeks after the interim chief executive of the fire service and the chairman of the fire authority both resigned following a dispute over fire authority governance.
The former, Oliver Lee, had publicly alleged WMFRA's governance lacked ""courage, transparency, care and honesty"".
He was appointed to the role following the death of the fire service's previous chief, Wayne Brown, in January 2024.
Mr Brown's death came shortly after the fire service confirmed he was being investigated for claims made on social media about his qualifications for the role.
Ben Brook was appointed in the wake of Mr Lee's departure but resigned just four days after taking the job.
The role has since been undertaken by Simon Tuhill, the ex-deputy fire chief for Northamptonshire, who pledged to bring stability to the service.
The newly announced corporate governance improvement board is to be created with support from the Local Government Association, and is subject to approval at the next full meeting of the fire authority on 17 February.
The plan is for the board to be independently chaired and include a mix of elected WMFRA members and external experts in governance, finance, and fire and rescue leadership.
The body is designed to ""provide oversight, challenge, and support to the authority as it considers any improvements identified following ongoing inspections and reviews"", WMFRA said.
An inspection was commissioned by the Home Office in December.
Councillor Cathy Bayton, chair of the fire authority, said: ""At the heart of West Midlands Fire Service are the dedicated firefighters, control room staff and support teams who serve our communities with professionalism and dedication every day. We are determined that their vital work is complemented by effective leadership and governance.
""The board will bring valuable external scrutiny and expertise, helping us to develop and strengthen our approach where necessary. We hope our communities take reassurance from this positive step.""
Councillor Wendy Maples, chair of the Local Government Association Fire Services Management Committee, said good governance was essential to good service provision, and that the fire authority was serious about addressing previous governance challenges positively.

Mr Postgate, together with Peter Firmin, created iconic children's TV shows from the 1960s and 70s including Ivor the Engine, Clangers, Pogles' Wood and Bagpuss.
Now Simon Postgate is celebrating his father's shows with five talks at the Alexander Centre in Faversham, Kent, about how they were made and shot in the studios of Small Films at Blean near Canterbury.
He said: ""There are various sorts of characters who were obviously him.""
He added: ""He was a bit like Mr Pogle, Noggin the Nog, Jones the Steam and of course Major Clanger the inventor.""
Mr Postgate's show Clangers, which featured knitted characters living on the moon, first broadcast in November 1969, a few months after the first moon landing.
His son said: ""For the Clangers, it begins with me opening the front door and finding my dad with the room completely dark except for the curtains, which were drawn, and he was looking out at the full moon in the night sky and listening to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon at full volume.""
He explained how he gave his father the idea for the series after telling him about a giant that lived on the dark side of the moon and drank soup from the middle with a straw.

Work included the cleaning of footpaths and weeds, along with the restoration of a sculpture designed by local children.
Damaged street furniture and litter had also been removed in a bid to curb anti-social behaviour, the council said.
Pocket parks are small areas of green space providing a place for the local community to enjoy.
Councillor Rob Pritchard, portfolio holder for culture and leisure at the authority, said: ""Pocket parks continue to help restore pride in community areas across the city.
""We have already seen the benefits the council's programme has brought to other areas, and it's pleasing to see more unloved areas, such as this one in Drypool, become attractive spaces for socialising and activities.""

The improvements will apply to the Dawsons Corner junction in Pudsey, Stanningley Bypass, and the Bramley area in Leeds which serve large volumes of traffic.
""Road users in Leeds and Bradford have experienced slow speeds on the A647 for too long, discouraging people from using local buses on the road,"" Lilian Greenwood, the roads minister, said.

Rutland County Council is set to discuss proposals to turn the Rutland County Museum into a cultural and civic centre.
Design work will begin if it is given the go-ahead and the authority hopes it will be able to acquire the famous sea dragon skeleton from Anglian Water and make it the centrepiece of the development.
The skeleton of the ichthyosaur - an ocean-going reptile from the time of the dinosaurs - was found at Rutland Water in 2021.
In addition to the skeleton, a digital visitor experience of the county's rare Roman Mosaic, discovered alongside remnants of a Roman villa in 2020, would also be part of the transformation.
Council leader Gale Waller said, if approved, the proposals would help boost tourism, support businesses and ensure the sustainability of ""Rutland's priceless heritage assets"". 

The cost of enhancing the museum would be covered by UK Government Funding, formerly known as Levelling Up Funding, worth £22.95m.
It would be spent on re-designing the building and Catmose Cottage site, where it is based in Oakham, as well as on interactive digital exhibits of the historic discoveries.
While the council's cabinet will discuss taking ownership of the ichthyosaur fossil from Anglian Water, the authority said it would need to secure extra funding before putting it on display.
Waller said the proposals would ""see the magnificent Rutland Ichthyosaur brought to life alongside other valuable local treasures inside a much-improved museum building"".
""This has huge potential in terms of attracting more visitors to our area, supporting local businesses and ensuring the long-term sustainability of Rutland's priceless heritage assets,"" she said.

The Wiltshire Police investigation revealed 70kg of the class A drug was supplied from 2016 to 2020 with links to an Albanian crime group.
Sentenced at Winchester Crown Court on Thursday, ringleader Warren Allison, 36, from Swindon, was jailed for 23 years, while his brother, Kelroy Allison, 41, from Hilperton, was jailed for 16.5 years.
Two of the group tried to flee the UK to avoid arrest, while police explained that Warren Allison had purchased a Lamborghini with his ""ill-gotten gains"". 
The investigation by the Wiltshire Police Serious Organised Crime Unit (Socu)  examined thousands of documents, phone reports and telecoms data as well as surveillance.
The gang, led by the Allison brothers, bought drugs in bulk and used encrypted communication networks to send smaller quantities.
They provided a specially-modified vehicle to a trusted driver - Richard Cowell, 57, from Freshbrook, Swindon. It had purpose-built concealment to hide the cocaine and cash, with Cowell using an EncroChat phone to talk to the Allisons.
Admitting to couriering for other crime groups too, he was jailed for nine years for conspiracy to supply cocaine.
Warren Allison's romantic interest, Porcia Densley, 38, of Melksham, acted as a ""finance manager"", collecting and delivering cash on his instruction. She was jailed for eight years.
Police seized drugs in Bristol when surveillance officers saw cocaine worth £320,000 to £400,000 being delivered to the Allisons' cousin, Anthony Burke.
Officers found the drugs in a bag for life.
Burke, 34, of Bristol, was jailed for eight years.
The cocaine was supplied by Albanian nationals Ledian Hoxha and Pjeter Pisha.
They fled the UK to try to evade arrest, but Hoxha, 38, was jailed for seven years and four months and Pisha, 37, for six years and eight months.
Enid Aliko, 28, was jailed for four years after he provided an encrypted device and acted as a contact for the Albanian crime group after the arrests. 
During the 12-week trial, the Allison brothers and Cowell claimed the messages were referring to fake clothes and not drugs.
Investigating officer Det Con Matthew Harvey of Socu said: ""Warren purchased numerous high value vehicles, including a Lamborghini Huracan, Mercedes C63 AMG and an Audi RS6, with his ill-gotten gains."" 
He explained that a ""significant operation"" had been ""broken up"", with cocaine being supplied across the region. 
""I hope these sentences show that those involved in organised criminal activity are not untouchable or above the law,"" he added.
Police said community intelligence was important in cases like these and asked people to report anything suspicious.

A report has set out the options for cabinet, with a decision expected on or after 27 February.
Last November, a list of sites that could be developed went before  a council scrutiny committee.
Sites included the Burghill Hospital Farm estate, Merton Meadow in Hereford, Bridge Street Sport Centre in Leominster, the Essex Arms site in Hereford and the County Bus Station.
Merton Meadow had seen £2m secured to address flood risks there and a flood-reducing public wetland was also earmarked for the Essex Arms site.
Smaller sites included Kington livestock market, the former Holme Lacy primary school, Westfield special school in Leominster and the Arrow Building which is currently a homeless shelter in Symonds Street, Hereford.
The report listed three models the council could take, which were overseeing building and management directly, setting up an ""arms-length"" housing provider, or forming a joint venture with an independent company.
Papers said the council was unusual in not having any such mechanism currently, but ""all require significant effort and resources, and take time to deliver"". 
Case studies looked at in other areas included development companies set up by other West Midlands councils.
They included Nuplace in Telford & Wrekin where the council had control over appointment of directors and Cornovii Homes in Shropshire where the council monitored operations and company performance.
WV Living in Wolverhampton had also been established with the aim of providing choice and offering local people the opportunity to buy high-quality, good value homes.
Herefordshire's cabinet is expected to back the idea later this month.

Pathfinder Clean Energy (PACE) ULDev Limited wants to build the solar farm on land north of Gray's Lane in Wissett near Halesworth, Suffolk.
It submitted plans to East Suffolk Council in August 2022 which have so far received 238 negative responses from the public as well as formal objections from nearby parish councils.
The application will be discussed by the council on Tuesday. 
Plans for the solar farm have been altered by the developer and it is now proposed to cover 41.7 hectares (103 acres) - less than half the area of the original plan.
One representation was received in support of the proposals, citing the need to embrace green energy projects and the need to rise above ""nimbyism"" (Not In My Back Yard).
But concerns cited by objectors include food security, location, landscape and visual harm, heritage harm and a lack of water supply, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Wissett, Spexhall, Rumburgh and Halesworth parish councils have objected to the plan.
The solar farm is proposed alongside a battery energy storage, consisting of 23 battery storage containers and seven inverter units, ancillary infrastructure and fencing.
It would operate for 40 years before being returned to its original condition, with ecological enhancements, and have the capacity for 27 megawatts, producing enough energy to power 10,518 homes in the district.
A statement submitted by PACE said the solar farm would provide low cost, clean power to businesses and employ local people during construction, with the additional power supplied to the grid helping to support housing development in the area.
Although planning officers at East Suffolk Council recognised the harm to heritage assets, landscape and visual impact, amenity and agricultural land, they concluded these were outweighed by the social and economic benefits of the scheme.

The 10 bed unit, currently run by Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership (AWP), offers in-patient care and treatment for adults over 18 who have difficulty controlling their drug or alcohol use.
Steve Rice, who launched a petition calling for the unit to be saved, said he is ""thrilled"" but added he will ""believe it when I see it"".
AWP said it will launch a consultation on the service and then decide on the unit's long-term future.
Bristol City Council commissioned four of the beds, North Somerset Council commissioned one, and the remaining five were available to any local authority on an ad-hoc basis.
The move would have seen the council's contract moving drug and alcohol services in the city to a new contractor - charity and social enterprise Turning Point - in partnership with the Bristol Drug Project.
They planned to buy medicalised detox inpatient beds elsewhere should the Acer Unit have closed.
Mr Rice's petition has been signed by more than 5,000 people as of Wednesday.
""I've hit them but I don't think I've knocked them out,"" he said.
He previously told the BBC the unit needed to stay open to save lives.
AWP said in a statement it recognises ""the impact Acer has had for those individuals and families who have used it"".
""We will share further details about this process which will include staff, patients, partners, stakeholders and the wider community, as soon as possible,"" it said.

Luton Council said children and young people with SEMH special needs could face significant challenges in regulating their emotions and behaviour. 
Currently these pupils often have to attend high-cost specialist placements at schools and independent settings outside Luton.
Subject to planning approval, the new school would be built on a disused part of playing fields at the back of William Austin Junior and Infant School and would feature a sports hall, five-a-side pitch and multi-use games area.
The council said in the past five years there had been a 100% increase in education, health and care plans (EHCPs) for pupils with SEMH special needs.
It said they may also struggle to engage with learning and cope in classrooms without additional strategies and interventions, and that a dedicated school in the town was now required.
The council said the school would be built in two phases, with the first phase accommodating 60 pupils in autumn 2027, and the second increasing the total capacity to 112. 
Labour councillor Javeria Hussain, portfolio holder for education, said: ""As part of our ambition for Luton to become a child-friendly town we are committed to providing high-quality education for all children and ensure that we meet the full range of their needs, including specialist provision in the town for children with social, emotional and mental health needs.""
A planning application would be submitted before Easter, the authority said.

He said he would ""love to see"" a new green space created in the town centre, allowing Christmas markets and other pop-up events to take place. 
The scheme forms part of the long-running Yeovil Refresh project, which will also see the former Glovers Walk shopping centre demolished and replaced.
Demolition work on the Glovers Walk shopping centre will be ramping up in the spring – with Mr Dance arguing that turning it into a public green space would allow a ""wider range of events"" to be held, pulling in people from across the south west.
He added: ""This area has been very tired for quite some time now, and we've had an awful lot of antisocial behaviour.""
Mr Dance believes that the town needs to become ""more vibrant"" to bring people in so that it can ""serve the residents within the constituency"", according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Councillor Richard Wilkins, portfolio holder for transport and waste services, said: ""Making this area more vibrant and bringing some life back into Yeovil is such an important aspect of what we've been doing here.""

Nottinghamshire Police relaunched a murder investigation last year.
On Wednesday, officers arrested three men aged 58, 57 and 55 on suspicion of murder. 
The arrests have come after searches for ammunition were made in connection with the case at a Nottingham home in January. 
The force said it had received information there could be evidence in the property in Sneinton but that no-one living at the address was connected to the murder.
Mr Ghafoor - known to friends and family as Shami - was shot dead in his car in the early hours of 22 November 1994.
He was found with his hands tied and bound to the steering wheel of his car by a milkman at Lambley Playing Fields in Gedling. 
The taxi driver had a five-year-old son at the time and his daughter was born five months after his death. 
Police have now arrested a total of nine people in connection with his death.
Ch Insp Clare Dean, who is leading the investigation, said: ""We made a commitment to Shami's family that we would leave no stone unturned when we relaunched the investigation last year.
""We continue to follow all new and existing lines of inquiry to ensure that his family get the answers they have waited for.""

According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, adding the likely precepts for the police and fire services, a Band D taxpayer in the borough is likely to pay about £2,152, with more to be added by individual parish councils.
The lowest precept levied by Swindon Borough Council will be £1,128 for Band A and the highest will be £3,386 for those in Band H properties.
The Police and Crime Commissioner for Wiltshire and Swindon, Philip Wilkinson is proposing an increase from £269.37 to £283.27 for Band D payers, just above a five per cent increase to help fund a £11m funding gap in Wiltshire Police's budget.
Meanwhile, the increase proposed by the Wiltshire and Dorset Fire Authority is 5.75%, rising to £91.95 for Band D payers.
There are 20 parish councils in Swindon who can also add their own precept to the bill - with no actual legal limit to the level of increase they can make. 
The highest Band D precept last year was levied by Highworth Town Council at £216. 
Next year's borough council draft budget will be discussed by cabinet councillors before going to a full council meeting on 26 February.
If approved, the new amount will be in bills sent out in March for payments starting in April.

The scheme at Marsh Park in Brierley Hill, in the West Midlands, is part of a £120,000 scheme which includes improvements to paths and wall repairs.
Volunteers from the Wolverhampton Archaeology Group worked with the Friends of Marsh Park and said they found the structure, thought to have been a manned post during the war.
The remains would now be left on display for people to see, the council said.
""It is likely the building served as a lookout post for German bombers who were attacking factories in the Black Country and Birmingham at that time,"" said councillor Paul Bradley.
Other work to the park included the planting of meadow grass and trees where the Knott Centre used to be based as well as a new viewing and seating area along with a new archway entrance.
Paths and the car park at St Michael's Church were also resurfaced as part of the scheme.
Frank Chamberlain, from the friends group, said it was ""great for the town"" to have a tangible link to its war time past.
He appealed for anyone with photos or information about the structure to contact his group.

Gloucestershire County Council staff will be painting the lines as part of a trial to improve safety.
The lines will be painted outside the five schools in each district that have recorded the highest number of collisions and received the highest number of parking complaints.
Amy Coole, assistant head teacher of Abbeymead Primary School, said: ""A lot of the unsafe parking practices could lead to an accident if they aren't addressed.""
The scheme, which has already been used in Blackpool, would see a fine issued to anybody caught stopping on the red lines, although the amount is yet to be confirmed.
Ms Coole said parking at Abbeymead Primary School is ""definitely a problem"", with parents and carers parking on zig zag lines, double yellows, grass verges and along junctions.
""We recently did a survey with our parents about safe travel practices and we had lots of parents respond,"" she said.
""The majority of comments highlighted that a lot of the unsafe parking practices could lead to an accident if they weren't addressed, so it's something we've been directly working on recently.""

Somerset Council has received £500,000 government funding for the scheme, which is taking place until the end of the tree planting season in March.
The grant will also pay for the trees to be maintained for the next three years.
Councillor Graham Oakes, portfolio holder for the environment and climate change, said: ""We're doing this because we need more trees. We only have tree cover of 8% and the national average is 13%.""
Benefits will include improving air quality, reducing road noise and absorbing water to reduce the risk of localised flooding, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. 
Of the 671 trees which are being planted in Somerset, 135 will be fruit-bearing, with the remainder being a mixture of native broad-leaf and non-native species.
Taunton will receive most of the trees, which will be distributed across Lyngford Park, Leslie Avenue, Victoria Park, Galmington Recreation Ground, Priorswood Football Field, Hamilton Park, Penny's Field, Taunton Green and Hawthorn Park (Upper Holway).
A further 100 trees will be coming to Yeovil, shared between Lower Milford, Milford Park, Oak Tree Park and Yew Tree Park, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Castle Cary will receive 74 trees, shared between its cricket ground and Fairfield, while 46 trees will be planted at the Somerton Recreation Ground.
Mr Oakes said: ""This initiative is another step towards enhancing our green spaces and a significant move towards ensuring cleaner air and a healthier environment for our communities.""

Kelvin Ramasta, who worked at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, was jailed at Peterborough Crown Court for four years and six months in April 2024 after admitting three counts of theft.
Ramasta, who said he was a ""good nurse"" but ""blinded by the money"", has since been struck off the nursing register by the Nursing and Midwifery Council.
The council's Fitness to Practise Committee panel heard he was suspended by the hospital trust in April 2022 and dismissed in January 2023.
Ramasta admitted stealing from three elderly and vulnerable patients who were under his care - £102,000 from ""Person A"", £203.29 from ""Person B"" and £1,000 from ""Person C"". 
Ramasta's bank referred a case to the police due to suspicious activity, after £101,000 was transferred into his account between 9 November 2021 and 22 April  2022, in increments of £1,000.
They were made from a bank account linked to Person A, who had dementia.
In April 2022, Person C's husband received a call from their bank concerning suspicious activity. 
When family visited the hospital they found money and the patient's bank card were missing.
Days later, Person C's husband received notification their bank received a cheque for £1,000 to be removed from their account, payable to Ramasta.
The panel noted remarks from the judge on sentencing, who said Ramasta stole ""all you could"" and the money was used to ""subsidise your life, gambling, luxury items for food and travel"".

In a regulatory concerns response form in June 2024, Ramasta admitted to the convictions but said he had only admitted the charges to get a lesser sentence.
In a case management form in October last year, he said: ""I've made [a] mistake but I know I'm a good nurse and have the skills of an excellent nurse.
""I help a lot of patients by providing quality care during Covid and post-Covid times.
""I was just blinded by the money and I'm sorry.
""I genuinely feel sorry for all the family I've mistaken with.""
The panel said there was ""a high risk of repetition as Mr Ramasta stole from three different patients on numerous different occasions in a pre-meditated and sophisticated manner"".

But, the BFI's chief executive tells BBC News, the industry is in good health overall.
UK box office revenue totalled £979m in 2024, with musical juggernaut Wicked taking the lion's share with £59.6m in ticket sales.
The total was only marginally down on 2023, but the BFI's report shows UK box office takings are still 22% below 2019, due in part to the Hollywood strikes and the ramifications of the Covid pandemic.
BFI chief executive Ben Roberts said the UK screen industries are not in crisis, but are beginning to stabilise after a tumultuous five years.
The report also highlighted the increase in production across the UK, with spending on British film and TV projects rising to a record £5.6bn.
Mr Roberts said this ""demonstrates the UK's strength as a world-leading destination for filmmaking"", showing that ""Britain's film and TV industries continue to be a powerhouse for creativity, investment and jobs"".
However, he acknowledged the data wasn't entirely positive, saying.
""We know these figures don't tell the whole story,"" he said. ""The 22% drop in domestic high-end TV spend is a reminder that many in the industry are feeling the pressure.""
Speaking to the BBC following the report's publication, Mr Roberts, who has been in charge of the BFI since 2020, said he is ""incredibly confident"" in the industry's continued recovery despite the mixed figures.
He pointed to the huge appetite for independent British and international films such as The Brutalist as evidence for audiences returning to cinemas for all types of films, not just blockbusters.
""The job right now I really feel is making sure that our offer is catering to everyone's tastes"", he said.
However, Mr Roberts did acknowledge the struggled faced by cinemas across the country as streaming has changed viewing habits worldwide.
""We recognise that we need to make sure that cinemas across the country are prospering. We haven't yet landed on the sort of simple solution to that prosperity but it's our focus right now.""
The report comes just over a week before the Bafta Film Awards, the most important event in the British film calendar.
While stars prepare to walk the red carpet and see if they can take home a coveted trophy, the report indicates the UK screen industry is still in recovery mode as it struggles to match the record-breaking 2010s.
Before the pandemic, UK box office takings consistently exceeded £1bn annually across blockbusters and smaller releases.
Although 2024's total take is only down 1% on 2023's figure of £980m, it is still a far cry from 2019's £1.3bn which saw audiences flock to cinemas for huge tentpoles such as Avengers: Endgame and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.
Cinema admissions were lower in the first half of 2024 owing to a lack of major US studio releases but high-profile films surged in the last three months of the year.
Alongside Wicked, five of the top 10 highest-earning films were November or December releases, including family films Moana 2, Paddington in Peru and Mufasa: The Lion King.
Ridley Scott's much-anticipated sequel Gladiator II earned £31.8m, while summer's superhero blockbuster Deadpool & Wolverine took £57.8m despite both having higher age ratings. 
Although audiences are clearly still showing up for major releases, film exhibition has faced an upward battle since 2020. 
Several independent cinemas have shut down - or are currently threatened with closure - while commercial chains such as Cineworld have gone into administration.
Cineworld has shut 11 cinemas over the past year including multiplexes in Nottingham and Bedford while an Odeon in Kettering is set to be demolished following its closure later this month.
Adrian Wootton OBE, chief executive of the British Film Commission, told BBC News that cinema closures paint ""a problematic picture"" for UK film.
""It's really important for the creative lifeblood of cinema"", he said, ""because I think it is the best place to start seeing movies"".
But, like Mr Roberts, he's feeling ""cautiously positive"" about the future because 2024, he said, is a transitional year as the industry waits for the market to settle and reach a ""new normal"". 
He pointed to the introduction of new tax credits alongside increased investment in films and high end TV from streaming services as reasons for cautious optimism.

Jack Wonfor, 24, spotted the mollusc sticking out at St Catherine's point on the southerly tip of the island.
After digging it out, it took eight hours using an electric engraver to uncover the complete full fossil from the excess rock.
Mr Wonfor said the fossil - a Mortoniceras inflatum - ""was roughly 100-105 million years old"".
The retained firefighter and guide for Wight Coast Fossils on the island said he was extremely happy to get it out complete as ammonites were ""hard to find with a complete rostrum"".
He added: ""In the rare cases they are preserved they are extremely difficult to extract from the rock without these rostrum breaking and being destroyed.""
Wight Coast Fossils said the find was ""absolutely stunning"".
""This is a well-preserved example of this relatively uncommon ammonite, it is certainly one of the most impressive we've come across,"" they added.
Mr Wonfor, who has been collecting fossils of marine invertebrates on the island since the age of four, said: ""It is one of my favourite fossils I have found over the years"".
He said he planned to keep it in his collection before donating it to the Dinosaur Isle Museum in Sandown.

A section of Chapel Street, between New Bailey Street and Blackfriars, will be redeveloped under Salford City Council's plans to boost walking and cycling routes around the city.
The authority said the work would ""rebalance the space in favour of pedestrians and cyclists"" alongside the existing traffic.
Salford mayor Paul Dennett said the works were part of a long-term plan for the city centre, with ""better road crossings and cycling provision"".
""Public realm improvements will also support the wider regeneration of the area to make it a much more attractive area for people,""  Dennett added.
The route is one of the busiest in the city, cutting through the Greengate area and leading to Manchester city centre, with access to Salford Central railway station.
New cycle tracks and pavements giving pedestrians and cyclists priority over side roads are planned, as well as improved crossing points along the street, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
The council said it wanted to give residents more choices for getting around Salford without having to rely on driving everywhere, with work planned to start in April and end in February 2026.
The £4.2m project, which is funded by the Greater Manchester Mayor's Cycling and Walking Challenge Fund, will include improved pavements and tree planting.

Ethsham Ul-Haq Ghafoor was 26 when he was shot dead in his taxi in Nottinghamshire in November 1994, in what police described as an ""execution"".
Nottinghamshire Police relaunched a murder investigation last year.
On Wednesday, officers arrested three men aged 58, 57 and 55 on suspicion of murder. 
The arrests have come after searches for ammunition were made in connection with the case at a Nottingham home in January. 
The force said it had received information there could be evidence in the property in Sneinton but that no-one living at the address was connected to the murder.
Mr Ghafoor - known to friends and family as Shami - was shot dead in his car in the early hours of 22 November 1994.
He was found with his hands tied and bound to the steering wheel of his car by a milkman at Lambley Playing Fields in Gedling. 
The taxi driver had a five-year-old son at the time and his daughter was born five months after his death. 
Police have now arrested a total of nine people in connection with his death.
Ch Insp Clare Dean, who is leading the investigation, said: ""We made a commitment to Shami's family that we would leave no stone unturned when we relaunched the investigation last year.
""We continue to follow all new and existing lines of inquiry to ensure that his family get the answers they have waited for.""

Somerset Council has received £500,000 government funding for the scheme, which is taking place until the end of the tree planting season in March.
The grant will also pay for the trees to be maintained for the next three years.
Councillor Graham Oakes, portfolio holder for the environment and climate change, said: ""We're doing this because we need more trees. We only have tree cover of 8% and the national average is 13%.""
Benefits will include improving air quality, reducing road noise and absorbing water to reduce the risk of localised flooding, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. 
Of the 671 trees which are being planted in Somerset, 135 will be fruit-bearing, with the remainder being a mixture of native broad-leaf and non-native species.
Taunton will receive most of the trees, which will be distributed across Lyngford Park, Leslie Avenue, Victoria Park, Galmington Recreation Ground, Priorswood Football Field, Hamilton Park, Penny's Field, Taunton Green and Hawthorn Park (Upper Holway).
A further 100 trees will be coming to Yeovil, shared between Lower Milford, Milford Park, Oak Tree Park and Yew Tree Park, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Castle Cary will receive 74 trees, shared between its cricket ground and Fairfield, while 46 trees will be planted at the Somerton Recreation Ground.
Mr Oakes said: ""This initiative is another step towards enhancing our green spaces and a significant move towards ensuring cleaner air and a healthier environment for our communities.""

204,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2j1jpnglvo,2025-02-07,"UK box office still below pre-pandemic levels, but BFI chief optimistic","A new report shows box office takings are still below pre-pandemic levels, despite the UK producing more films and television shows. But, the BFI's chief executive tells BBC News, the industry is in good health overall.
UK box office revenue totalled £979m in 2024, with musical juggernaut Wicked taking the lion's share with £59.6m in ticket sales.
The total was only marginally down on 2023, but the BFI's report shows UK box office takings are still 22% below 2019, due in part to the Hollywood strikes and the ramifications of the Covid pandemic.
BFI chief executive Ben Roberts said the UK screen industries are not in crisis, but are beginning to stabilise after a tumultuous five years.
The report also highlighted the increase in production across the UK, with spending on British film and TV projects rising to a record £5.6bn.
Mr Roberts said this ""demonstrates the UK's strength as a world-leading destination for filmmaking"", showing that ""Britain's film and TV industries continue to be a powerhouse for creativity, investment and jobs"".
However, he acknowledged the data wasn't entirely positive, saying.
""We know these figures don't tell the whole story,"" he said. ""The 22% drop in domestic high-end TV spend is a reminder that many in the industry are feeling the pressure.""
Speaking to the BBC following the report's publication, Mr Roberts, who has been in charge of the BFI since 2020, said he is ""incredibly confident"" in the industry's continued recovery despite the mixed figures.
He pointed to the huge appetite for independent British and international films such as The Brutalist as evidence for audiences returning to cinemas for all types of films, not just blockbusters.
""The job right now I really feel is making sure that our offer is catering to everyone's tastes"", he said.
However, Mr Roberts did acknowledge the struggled faced by cinemas across the country as streaming has changed viewing habits worldwide.
""We recognise that we need to make sure that cinemas across the country are prospering. We haven't yet landed on the sort of simple solution to that prosperity but it's our focus right now.""
The report comes just over a week before the Bafta Film Awards, the most important event in the British film calendar.
While stars prepare to walk the red carpet and see if they can take home a coveted trophy, the report indicates the UK screen industry is still in recovery mode as it struggles to match the record-breaking 2010s.
Before the pandemic, UK box office takings consistently exceeded £1bn annually across blockbusters and smaller releases.
Although 2024's total take is only down 1% on 2023's figure of £980m, it is still a far cry from 2019's £1.3bn which saw audiences flock to cinemas for huge tentpoles such as Avengers: Endgame and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.
Cinema admissions were lower in the first half of 2024 owing to a lack of major US studio releases but high-profile films surged in the last three months of the year.
Alongside Wicked, five of the top 10 highest-earning films were November or December releases, including family films Moana 2, Paddington in Peru and Mufasa: The Lion King.
Ridley Scott's much-anticipated sequel Gladiator II earned £31.8m, while summer's superhero blockbuster Deadpool & Wolverine took £57.8m despite both having higher age ratings. 
Although audiences are clearly still showing up for major releases, film exhibition has faced an upward battle since 2020. 
Several independent cinemas have shut down - or are currently threatened with closure - while commercial chains such as Cineworld have gone into administration.
Cineworld has shut 11 cinemas over the past year including multiplexes in Nottingham and Bedford while an Odeon in Kettering is set to be demolished following its closure later this month.
Adrian Wootton OBE, chief executive of the British Film Commission, told BBC News that cinema closures paint ""a problematic picture"" for UK film.
""It's really important for the creative lifeblood of cinema"", he said, ""because I think it is the best place to start seeing movies"".
But, like Mr Roberts, he's feeling ""cautiously positive"" about the future because 2024, he said, is a transitional year as the industry waits for the market to settle and reach a ""new normal"". 
He pointed to the introduction of new tax credits alongside increased investment in films and high end TV from streaming services as reasons for cautious optimism.

Jack Wonfor, 24, spotted the mollusc sticking out at St Catherine's point on the southerly tip of the island.
After digging it out, it took eight hours using an electric engraver to uncover the complete full fossil from the excess rock.
Mr Wonfor said the fossil - a Mortoniceras inflatum - ""was roughly 100-105 million years old"".
The retained firefighter and guide for Wight Coast Fossils on the island said he was extremely happy to get it out complete as ammonites were ""hard to find with a complete rostrum"".
He added: ""In the rare cases they are preserved they are extremely difficult to extract from the rock without these rostrum breaking and being destroyed.""
Wight Coast Fossils said the find was ""absolutely stunning"".
""This is a well-preserved example of this relatively uncommon ammonite, it is certainly one of the most impressive we've come across,"" they added.
Mr Wonfor, who has been collecting fossils of marine invertebrates on the island since the age of four, said: ""It is one of my favourite fossils I have found over the years"".
He said he planned to keep it in his collection before donating it to the Dinosaur Isle Museum in Sandown.

A section of Chapel Street, between New Bailey Street and Blackfriars, will be redeveloped under Salford City Council's plans to boost walking and cycling routes around the city.
The authority said the work would ""rebalance the space in favour of pedestrians and cyclists"" alongside the existing traffic.
Salford mayor Paul Dennett said the works were part of a long-term plan for the city centre, with ""better road crossings and cycling provision"".
""Public realm improvements will also support the wider regeneration of the area to make it a much more attractive area for people,""  Dennett added.
The route is one of the busiest in the city, cutting through the Greengate area and leading to Manchester city centre, with access to Salford Central railway station.
New cycle tracks and pavements giving pedestrians and cyclists priority over side roads are planned, as well as improved crossing points along the street, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
The council said it wanted to give residents more choices for getting around Salford without having to rely on driving everywhere, with work planned to start in April and end in February 2026.
The £4.2m project, which is funded by the Greater Manchester Mayor's Cycling and Walking Challenge Fund, will include improved pavements and tree planting.

Southeastern said at 07:22 GMT there was a ""failure of the electricity supply"" at Tonbridge station.
Due to the power failure, trains travelling towards London from Hastings were unable to stop at the station and services from Ashford to London needed to use an alternative platform to the normal one.
Services in both directions through the station were affected.
Southeastern said just before midday that Network Rail had completed repairs and trains could now begin to serve Tonbridge as per the usual timetable.
During the disruption, rail replacement buses operated between Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells.
Passengers who were delayed by more than 15 minutes reaching their final destination, can claim back some compensation via the delay repay scheme.
Southern services between Tonbridge and Redhill were unaffected by the issues.

Royal Stafford, based at the Royal Overhouse Manufactory in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, called in administrators and stopped trading on Tuesday.
Insolvency firm Moore Recovery said the company had faced a dramatic reduction in orders and, along with energy price rises, it could not continue to trade.
At a meeting organised by the GMB Union on Thursday, Sean Ralphs, who worked at the firm for the past 35 years, described the closure as a ""nightmare"".
He said the closure came at the ""wrong time"" for him as it was just days after his wife Shirley, who also worked at the business, had had an operation on Saturday.
Mr Ralphs said he felt sorry for younger people who were struggling and have no savings.
""I've been around 35 years, I know nothing else,"" he said. ""Ninety-nine percent of people...we live week to week.""
Mrs Ralphs said her husband had phoned her on Monday to tell her the factory was shut.
""We'll be fine,"" she added.
Robert Morley, who worked at the pottery for 15 years, arranged the meeting to help people find out about possible redundancy packages and other companies they could work for.
""The tears last night were unbelievable,"" he told BBC Radio Stoke.
""The pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent needs action now because it won't be long before another factory goes.""
Other former members of staff who attended described the ceramics business as slow and said it was a ""dying trade"".
Kathleen Meir said she was ""devastated"" at the news but it had been apparent the company was struggling.
""Gutted, can't say it wasn't a shock as we did see it coming,"" she said.
""There was loads of slowing down, there was hardly any orders.
""I work in the packing department, I actually see the orders going out and [there] wasn't much going out at all.""
The Royal Stafford brand was established in 1845 and the firm described itself as one of the handful of potteries with all production taking place in England.
In a statement on its website, the company said Moore Recovery was instructed to put it into voluntary liquidation.
A spokesperson for the administrators added a closing down sale was planned and more information would be shared ""when possible"".

The applicant, Chukwuemeka Madumere, told planners that the house in  Donnington would be used for ""two vulnerable children to call home.""
The two children would be aged from seven to 17, which, the committee was told, would make it like any other family home in the area.
However councillor Lisa Dugmore, representing Donnington & Muxton Parish Council, appealed for councillors not to approve the plan ""in its current form.""
She said the council had received ""many representations from members of the public.""
""It is in the middle of an elderly residential area,"" she told Telford & Wrekin Council's planning committee.
The four-bed chalet would have four parking spaces and a garage - for two members of staff and one manager.
Planners considered that to be a good provision which would not add to pavement parking in the area.
""It will be a true home for children to feel safe, for emotional support and to have a place to grow,"" said Mr Madumere.
""We will be ensuring that vulnerable children have a place to call home. 
""It will be a home, not an institution. It will be a positive addition to the local community.""
Councillor Peter Scott said that, for similar applications, many of the objections were ""based on fear of what these young people might do.""
""It is going to be two kids who need care.
""I don't see anything bad about this, we have a duty to care for children.""

Marine FC, based in Crosby, Sefton, said it wants to ""safeguard the club for the next 100 years"" by increasing its capacity to 5,000.
The proposed new stadium, which still requires planning permission, will include a community hub with health and wellness facilities.
Marine's chief executive James Leary said: ""I think if we don't go for it we'll regret it"".
The club said its fanbase has grown exponentially in recent years. 
Mr Leary said since it played Premier League giants Tottenham Hotspur in the 2021 FA Cup third round, it has won two promotions and average attendance has increased from 350 to 1,400.

The service included a guard of honour, the playing of the Last Post, and a force chaplain led the gathering in a prayer.
After the service, West Midlands Police Federation representatives laid a wreath at Albert Willits' grave and said a few words. 
Heritage manager Corinne Brazier, who helped arrange the anniversary service, said: ""Albert's story is a poignant reminder of the dedication and sacrifices made by police officers to protect the public, prevent crime and catch criminals.
""We wanted to remember and honour Albert, along with his family members, to ensure his legacy lives on. He will forever be part of our policing family.""

Eleven artists have been shortlisted, from 60 responses to the Flourishing Barnstaple scheme, and asked to develop their ideas further.
The project is led by North Devon Council with a total budget of £200,000 from Art Council England's cultural development fund.
The proposals will be displayed at the Museum of Barnstaple and North Devon, Barnstaple Pannier Market, Green Lanes Shopping Centre and online from Wednesday 12 February.
The aim of Flourishing Barnstaple is to revitalise the town centre and promote cultural activity with public art.
People can vote for their favourite design by filling in a form or voting online.
The public's views will be considered with those of a selection panel of representatives from North Devon Council, Barnstaple Town Council, Barnstaple town team for culture and the community.
Councillor Mark Haworth-Booth, the cultural partnership board representative for North Devon Council, said there was an ""incredible response"" to the invitation for designs.
""The winning project will take pride of place in the town centre, so we want as many people as possible to take a look at the proposals and have their say,"" he added.
North Devon Council said a week of voting is set to close at midnight on Wednesday 19 February and the results are due to be announced in March.

220,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c626177yndzo,2025-02-09,Herefordshire 4.99% council tax rise confirmed,"A 4.99% council tax increase, the maximum permitted, has been confirmed for Herefordshire from April. 
People living in band D households will have their charge increased by £7.80 a month, totalling to £1,969.36 a year.
Herefordshire Council said it expects to spend £231.5m in 2025-26 - £146.5m of which will come from council tax payers. 
Business rates are expected to bring in £47.5m, with various grants making up the rest, said Councillor Pete Stoddart at a budget meeting on Friday. 
But he warned the council faced ""unfunded pressures"" totalling a further £27m in the year ahead, including additional demand on its services, chiefly adult social care, of £13m, and inflationary pressure of £10.5m.
In addition, £2m more is forecast to go on higher pay, with a further £1.5m from the recent increase in employers' national insurance contributions ""having a direct impact on the council's pay bill"", Stoddart explained.
Council leader Jonathan Lester said the tax rise was ""unavoidable"", adding: ""We are able to fund further investment in roads, maintaining the freeze on parking charges, increase flood resilience, and progress with the project to deliver the Western Bypass, whilst balancing the budget.""
Councillor Terry James backed the plan, pointing out the government had cut nearly £7m from the Rural Services Grant it previously gave Herefordshire to offset the costs of its rural nature.
""But we are in a better position than adjoining councils,"" he said.
The final setting of council tax, including ""precepts"" for local parishes, police and fire services, will be confirmed in March.

The council had expressed ""regret"" last year over how it announced the planned closures of 13 library buildings, after a community backlash about a lack of consultation.
Those which had been announced as under threat were in Balmedie, Boddam, Cairnbulg, Cruden Bay, Insch, Inverbervie, Kintore, Macduff, New Pitsligo, Newmachar, Newtonhill, Rosehearty and Strichen.
Services for Inverbervie, Cairnbulg and Boddam would be delivered elsewhere if councillors approve new recommendations.
Live Life Aberdeenshire, which runs services for the council, announced the planned closures of the 13 libraries in November last year.
The latest plan suggests that three library buildings be declared surplus to requirements.
Library buildings in Rosehearty, Kintore, Insch and Newtonhill could remain open through changes to working arrangements and a drive to recruit more volunteers.
A report to the council's communities committee says that some groups have expressed an interest in taking over libraries in Balmedie, Strichen and New Pitsligo.
Officers are still discussing options for future library services in Cruden Bay, Newmachar and Macduff.
An update on those talks will be published ahead of the committee's meeting on 5 June.

South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) is working throughout the month to reduce the number of knife crimes in Hampshire and the Thames Valley, highlight the impact such crimes have, and teach the public emergency first aid.
There were 2,160 stabbings in the area covered by SCAS in the 12-month period up to September 2024, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).
Patrick Green, CEO of knife crime charity the Ben Kinsella Trust, said education was ""our most powerful tool in the fight against knife crime"".
""Awareness raising campaigns are so important,"" he said.
""We need to equip young people with the knowledge and skills to navigate potentially dangerous situations and understand the devastating consequences of knife crime.""
SCAS said it had a number of events planned for the month - including a short film of Amanda Stephens, the mother of Olly Stephens who was fatally stabbed in Reading, meeting the operational commander who was on the scene that day, for the first time since the attack.
The ambulance service said it was working with Slough Borough Council, Thames Valley Police, Slough Youth Council and Together as One to host an event in Langley teaching young people emergency first aid.
Mark Ainsworth-Smith MBE, consultant pre-hospital care practitioner for SCAS, said: ""Tragically we see a significant number of deaths caused by knife crime and violence in our ambulance service every year.
""Every one of those deaths is a tragedy for families and friends, and they cause terrible trauma to all those involved, including the police, ambulance service and other emergency responders who have to deal with the consequences.""
SCAS said there was evidence showing campaigns were effective at reducing knife crime, with a study across Hampshire and the Isle of Wight showing knife crime offences had fallen by 19% since 2022.
But Mr Green said reducing knife crime was not just about statistics.
""It's about changing attitudes and behaviours,"" he said.
""By talking directly to young people, we can address their fears, dispel misinformation, and empower them to make positive choices.""

The scheme at B5493 Aldergate and A513 Upper Gungate will see reconstruction and resurfacing of highway between Lichfield Street and Comberford Road.
The project will be spilt into five different phases, with one worked on at a time.
The first phase of works will take place at Aldergate, between the signalised junction of Lichfield Street and the junction of Corporation Street.
Work will also include improvements to a section of Offa Drive, along with repairs to kerbs, crossings and ironwork in the area.
Staffordshire County Council's cabinet member for highways Rob Pritchard said it was fantastic to see the scheme move forward.
""This is not only a key local traffic route, but many drivers use it to get to the M42, Ashby, Alrewas, Burton and the National Memorial Arboretum,"" he said.
Road closures will be in place, with signed diversions. Access will be maintained for residents and businesses where safe to do so.
The project is expected to take about 12 weeks to complete and is said by the council to be part of a wider £45m investment in the county's roads over three years.

225,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4z07kvyz0o,2025-02-05,Phone-free policy has had positive impact at school,"A school has said that locking away pupils' mobile phones in a special pouch during the day has had a positive impact.
Kingswood School in Bath said its phone-free policy had helped children to focus on their lessons and encouraged social interaction. 
Mobiles are placed in a pouch with a magnetic locking device that makes the phone inaccessible until it is released, so that pupils are not tempted to use their phone.
Head of middle school at Kingswood, Sarah Herlinger, said: ""We've seen pupils interacting, spending time on their homework. It's just creating a really lovely buzz around school.""
Kingswood, an independent school, introduced the pouches in September after carrying out a survey of pupils, parents and teachers.
To access the magnetic pouches, students must ask a teacher for permission, or use an unlocking pad placed at entry points to the school to release their phone when they leave at the end of the day.
The school said government guidance issued in February 2024 instructing all schools to adopt a phone-free policy had prompted the change.
The pouches costs £30, but Mrs Herlinger said some pupils had decided not to use them.
""There is a significant number of children from year seven to year eleven who have said 'I'm never going to have my phone in school' so they're obviously not needing to pay for it.""
Pupils Emmy and George think the change has been positive.
""I think everyone was quite surprised when it came in, but it's made everyone more sociable,"" said George.
Emmy added: ""It's quite good because people talk more, you kind of get to know people better instead of having your phone out.""
Mrs Herlinger said: ""When we have those conversations about phone use and regulating phone use we know that's a really unfair expectation on a child.
""I think we're doing right by them by creating a culture where it's okay not to be on your phone, it's okay to have a break from that.""

226,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yv7448my2o,2025-02-06,Knife crime campaigner calls for school bleed kits,"A Redditch campaign group wants to equip all local schools with bleed kits amid rising concerns over knife crime.
It follows high-profile attacks across the country, including the fatal stabbing of 15-year-old Harvey Willgoose in Sheffield.
Self-defence expert Peter Martin, who leads Redditch's Drop the Knife Campaign, said people were becoming increasingly concerned.
He said schools and parents had been in contact about organising kits in schools, but added: ""You hope and pray it's never needed.""
He said he had been contacted by five schools on Thursday alone, and parents had been in touch wanting to donate funds or kits.
Redditch Self Defence Association's website, which is run by Mr Martin, states it has supplied 85 kits to the community that are endorsed by the ambulance service and registered in a national database.
Mr Martin said it was rare for a young person to take a blade into school, but added: ""Since going back from Christmas break, I've supported two young people just in Redditch that have taken knives to school.""
Explaining why youngsters sought help, he said: ""They're scared. They hear things on social media. They're worried about being bullied or other people having knives – so fear is always the number one driver.""
He said he ran school assemblies where role-play showed carrying a knife ""not only doesn't keep you safe, it puts you in more harm"".
He said: ""You can be injured just by carrying a sharp instrument. We have young people that just have accidents.""
Carrying a blade could escalate situations, he said.
""They access the bladed article thinking the other person is going to somehow say 'I'm scared' and run off, but if they're a dangerous individual themselves they could access their own weapon, it could escalate problems, it could create a fight.""

Currently, a police hub is open two days a week in Corby, Northamptonshire - a situation Labour MP Lee Barron criticised.
In a letter to Chief Constable Ivan Balhatchet, he said: ""The current service is just not good enough. It is time to review resources and set up a police station and a dedicated response unit which can meet the demands of our communities.""
Police, fire and crime commissioner, Danielle Stone, and the chief constable said there was a visit planned in Corby in the next few weeks, and they had contacted Mr Barron for his involvement.
Police officers moved out of their station in Elizabeth Street to a hub at the multimillion-pound Corby Cube in 2017.
In his letter, the MP emphasised his concerns were not a criticism of frontline officers, who he said were working hard with limited resources. 
Instead, he argued that Corby residents deserved a response unit capable of meeting the town's policing demands, and would raise the issue in Parliament to the policing minister. 
Mr Barron added: ""I urge you to support an uplift in Corby's policing provision and would welcome the opportunity to meet with you as soon as possible to discuss how we can improve this situation.""
In a statement, Ms Stone and Mr Balhatchet said: ""We have already reopened the front office at Campbell Square police station in Northampton to make it more accessible to the public, and we are actively looking at ways to give Northamptonshire Police a stronger presence in the county's other major towns – Corby is high on the list.
""Across the county, this could be through shared hubs with other organisations, seeking innovative ways of engaging the community, or by opening new facilities of our own, and we will balance the needs of the community with the operational demands of policing.
""We are working on this as fast as we can to ensure police officers are visible and accessible in the heart of neighbourhoods across the county.""

Alex McCarthy, from Kempston, Bedfordshire, at 28 weeks pregnant, said she was hoping to give birth at home, and was left unable to plan and ""sad that I might miss out on an experience that was important to me"".
Bedford Hospital said its Blossom Homebirth service was put under review for three months, due to staff shortages, but it has now been extended for a second time, to the end of March. 
Emma Hardwick, director of midwifery at Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said ""care will not be compromised"", while the review continues.
In October, the hospital said it put its homebirth service ""under review due to significant staffing challenges"" and it was extended to the end of December, and then the end of March, it said.
Emma Dakers-Black, from Shefford, is expecting her second child in April and said she gets different messages from each person she speaks to.
She has been told homebirths will be passed onto community midwives ""but no one seems to be making a plan about how it will work"". 
""I just want to have the choice to have the next baby at home and have the confidence my choice will be met at my time of need"", she added.
Ms McCarthy said: ""There is a massive air of uncertainty, I was hoping for a homebirth but that decision could be taken away at any time.
""What's important, as a women who is preparing to have a baby, is to feel safe, you build relationships with your midwife and knowing that might not happen is uneasy and worrying. 
""The best place for me is to be a home, in a calming and comfortable environment,"" she added.
Amy Simpson, a former midwife with Blossom, left in October 2024. 
When she started she said there were seven midwives, running a 24-hour service, but that number reduced to four part-time midwives and the team ""struggled to cover the service"".
She decided to resign when she was put on call three times a week. 
""When I was on the team, we gave women a really good service and it was an asset to the hospital, it had a really good reputation, it had good feedback and good outcomes - the trust's home birth rate was higher than the average.
""I feel sad it could come to an end. If it's not broken, there's no need to fix it, it should stay, they need to recruit more midwives"", she said.
Charlie Hawksworth, from Wootton, had an elected homebirth for her third child.
She believes it is ""an unfair situation that the choice could be taken away"". 
""If you decide you want a homebirth, you should absolutely be able to have one.""
She hopes the hospital will be able to restructure so it can continue.
Ms Hardwick said the decision had ""not been taken lightly and reflects our commitment to ensuring the highest standards of safety, quality, and equity in maternity care"". 
She said it would be thoroughly evaluating the service and while the review takes place ""care will not be compromised"". 
Homebirths were still being offered and anyone ""under the care of the Blossom Homebirth team will be supported by community midwives"", she added.

The founder and CEO of hospitality group Nightcap Limited has signed a 115-year deal with Brighton & Hove City Council to run the tower and site for an undisclosed fee.
The council wiped off £51m in debt to secure the sale after the tourist attraction closed down in November. 
Brighton resident Ms Willingham told BBC Radio Sussex it would take about 28 days to get the tower going ""up and down again"".
She said: ""It may be we can even get it done sooner.
""What we are being told is the minimum amount of time in terms of just getting the engine, the mechanics of it up and running and commissioned. 
""That would take us to the beginning of March.""
Ms Willingham - who was in the BBC Two show Dragon's Den in 2015 and 2016 - says she will be refurbishing the tourist attraction even after opening.
She added: ""We will just keep opening piecemeal - a bit at a time.""
Ms Willingham hinted the 531ft (162m) tower - where adult tickets previously cost £18.50  - may become more affordable. 
She said: ""I am adamant that this whole area will be used by locals, by my friends and locals that live here, [and] that pricing is done right.""
The Nightcap Ltd CEO says she wants to turn the bars and cafes at the site into a ""hub"" for Brighton residents and tourists alike. 
The deal will see 1% of i360 tower ticket sales revenue go to Brighton & Hove City Council.
She said the council is ""open"" to the Nightcap's input on how they spend the 1% revenue. 
Deputy council leader Jacob Taylor said despite historic issues, the purchase was ""good news"" for local businesses.
He said: ""You've got a huge structure, a huge attraction on the sea front. It is now going to be back operating, bringing in hundreds of thousands of visitors per year, helping those businesses.""
Sian Berry, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: ""This is great news for the local business owners who I know were worried about the potential for total demolition that was being discussed by some in the council, and I am excited to talk with the new owners about how we build up the positivity about this crucial area of our seafront.
""As things progress, it's important that the council is transparent about the sale and residents get full sight of the details, including the proportion of revenue the city will receive.""

Wiltshire-based Downton Football Club has teamed up with charity YoungMinds to launch the campaign after Alice Clark, the daughter of one of the club's volunteers, took her own life.
The club's 'Pause for Thought' campaign urges people to think twice before posting online.
""Negative words written about a person on social media can have a significant negative impact on their mental health,"" a club spokesperson said.
They added negative posts can cause ""anxiety, stress, depression, and lowered self-esteem"" if they are widely shared.
""Think how it would make the writer feel if reading the words about themselves.
""Think about how the words used might reflect them as an individual,"" they added.
Players will also take part a minute's silence before some league matches this year.
Club volunteer Paula Henley, who also lost a family member to suicide, said Downton FC held a special match on Boxing Day as a fundraiser for YoungMinds in memory of Alice, who was 15.

Babergh District Council met on Wednesday to discuss the submitted plans for the solar farm in Bentley near Ipswich.
Green Switch Capital's plans received 13 letters in support while 175 residents submitted objections.
Planning officers had previously recommended the plans were refused which councillors unanimously agreed to follow.
The application was for a site between Potash Lane and Church Road in the village, mostly located on land of the best quality for agriculture, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
The solar farm, with up to 40 MW of export capacity, would be built on 48.3 hectares (119.3 acres) alongside ancillary infrastructure and cabling, two substations, and new vehicular accesses.
Bentley, Capel St Mary and Tattingstone parish councils submitted objections to the plans.
Speaking at the meeting, Michael Bamford, a Bentley parish councillor, shared many of the concerns, including fears the solar panels would ""industrialise"" the landscape and leave ""lasting damage"".
Thomas Hill, an objector, said the plans had brought anxiety to residents and stressed best quality land, landscape, and heritage assets should not be sacrificed to build a solar farm.
Assessing the application, officers backed concerns with a recommendation for refusal on the grounds of significant landscape and heritage harm.
Despite the opposition, Tom Roseblade, the agent, said the company disputed the impacts on the landscape and stressed the benefits of the solar farm.
He stressed these benefits outweighed the potential harm and suggested the plans could still be approved by the planning inspector even if they were refused by the district council.
Liberal Democrat and Bentley ward member, David Busby, argued the historical setting of the site made the plans ""totally inappropriate"".
""Much of the historical assets around it go back to the medieval times, this has remained unchanged for that kind of period, it's very unique in that,"" he added.
""It is an area that deserves conserving, you don't get this kind of landscape and heritage anywhere else, it's unique.

236,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdxpq8nq5vo,2025-02-07,Free evening city parking set to end within weeks,"Free on-street evening parking in Liverpool city centre could be brought to an end within weeks.
It is currently free after 18:00, but Liverpool City Council is set to extend the charging period to run from 07:00 to 23:00 daily.
The plans were first mooted in November 2022 as the council looked to plug an expanding budget gap.
But after a delay of several years, a senior official has now confirmed the fees will kick in from the end of March at the latest.
The move comes almost two months after the council's cabinet signed off on a rise in parking charges generally.
Liverpool City Council said the plans to end free parking after 18:00 GMT were designed to create more spaces for those holding resident and business permits, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
In December, the council approved a significant hike in parking fees that will come into force from next year, with fees to rise by as much as 70% in some places. 
The council is currently working up its budget options for April and beyond as it looks to fill a £29m blackhole.
Pressures around social care and homelessness have added to the need to generate cash to balance the books. 
As a result, city car parks will now cost more to drivers from March, with hourly rates also on the increase.
Councillor Ruth Bennett, deputy leader of Liverpool Council and cabinet member for finance, said the existing scheme was ""out of kilter"" with other major cities across the UK. 
The most significant planned increase is for on-street car parking, where charges will rise by an average of 60%. 
A four-hour stay in a city centre bay will increase from £6 to £9.60.

He said: ""There was this real energy of, we're making something that is both totally familiar and something I think people are going to love, but with an air of freshness and looking to the future.""
Mr Strange's first job was as a graphic designer in his home city of Leicester, but decided to strike out somewhere new in his twenties.

The West Midlands officer, named by the force only as PC Uddin, was found to have committed gross misconduct at a disciplinary hearing.
The officer, based at Stechford police station in Birmingham, contacted the woman repeatedly from his work and personal phones after he carried out a welfare check in May.
In his report, Chief Constable Craig Guildford said the officer's actions ""were devoid of integrity"".
The hearing heard PC Uddin carried out the check in May after the woman reported that she had been a victim of domestic abuse.
He then made several calls or attempts at calls to the woman the day after, including some late at night.
The move to continuing contact through his personal phone was described as ""unprofessional"" in the report which added it ""gave the impression that you were developing or intending to develop a personal relationship with a vulnerable female"".
The officer did not tell his supervisor or update the police systems about the off-duty contact, they added.
A second allegation against the officer was that he did not admit the contact during a West Midlands Police interview in January 2024, including denying any evidence of the contact would be found on his phone.
He later admitted it in a follow up interview in October.
The report said PC Uddin claimed his contact was made with ""good intentions"".
It was decided at the hearing that the officer had breached professional behaviour standards to the level of gross misconduct.
Chief Con Guildford wrote: ""This officer's actions were devoid of integrity in so far as he knew what he was doing in consciously deciding to make so many contacts with a vulnerable victim of crime both on and off-duty on both his works and then later his own mobile phone.
""Consequently, I find the officer to be individually culpable and his culpability is particularly high as is the level of seriousness in this case.""
The officer was told he had the right to appeal against his dismissal.

The Buxton Library of Things first opened on 30 January 2024 at Buxton Library with the aim of making the town more sustainable.
The initiative, founded by environmental group Transition Buxton, offers items such as tools, DIY supplies and electronic goods for a set time at a low cost.
Jane Reynolds, director of Transition Buxton, said: ""We want people to reduce buying things they may only use a few times and to borrow more.""
The service, which offers more than 100 items, aims to reduce individual purchases of rarely-used goods and the amount of items going to landfill, while encouraging sharing in the community.
Ms Reynolds said she wanted to bring a library of things to Buxton because she noticed other schemes were successful elsewhere.
""We wanted to reduce waste in our community, so we set up a repair café in Buxton and we wanted a library of things that reduces people buying things they may only use a few times, reduces clutter in homes and saves people money as well,"" she added.
Ms Reynolds said the library's most used items are power washers, carpet cleaners, hedge trimmers and gazebos in the summer.
People pay for a membership for the service and then do a ""pay as you feel"" fee for every item borrowed.
Some members travel more than 30 miles from Derby to borrow things from the library.
Ms Reynolds said: ""We are really pleased reaching one year and we hope people will borrow more and more. 
""We hope Library of Things will open in other towns too because it's a shame there isn't a library of things closer to members like that in Derby.""
The Library of Things was set up following a small start-up grant from the National Lottery, but is now self-funded, Transition Buxton said.

The Royal Oak pub in Chapel Ash, Wolverhampton, sold its final pint of Banks's Mild at the end of January, after Carlsberg Marston's Brewing Company decided to cut a number of their beers.
Terry Cole, the pub's landlord, has decided to put his last three Banks's pump clips up for auction and raise money for a blood bike charity, Midlands Freewheelers.
""Lots of people were saying 'I want that', so I thought the fairest way to decide was  a silent auction for our good friends"", Mr Cole said.
The clips on offer are Banks's Mild, Banks's Sunbeam and Marston's Old Empire, which are three of the eleven beers affected.
The iconic pump clips had overseen the delivery of more than 100,000 pints over 18 years, Mr Cole added. 
The pub had also started selling the Banks's glasses to raise some extra cash for charity. 
""It gives people the chance to have a little bit of history and own their own Banks's clip or glass"", he said. 
The pub had hoped to raise £200 for the charity, but bids have already reached nearly double that. 
Lorraine Gough, chairperson of the charity, said the free service operates 24 hours a day and transports, blood, chemotherapy drugs, medication, breast milk and ""anything they can transport safely"" between hospitals on behalf of the NHS. 
""We pass their pub regularly on the way to West Park Hospital, their customers continue to support us and Terry even works as a coordinator for the charity, taking calls from the hospitals and dispatching riders,"" Ms Gough added. 
""It would be amazing to donate as much money as we can, they are a great bunch and it would help them massively,"" Mr Cole said. 
He added that previous charity events hosted by the pub had raised enough money to buy the charity a new motorbike. 
The auction ends on Saturday at 17:00 GMT.

The founder and CEO of hospitality group Nightcap Limited has signed a 115-year deal with Brighton & Hove City Council to run the tower and site for an undisclosed fee.
The council wiped off £51m in debt to secure the sale after the tourist attraction closed down in November. 
Brighton resident Ms Willingham told BBC Radio Sussex it would take about 28 days to get the tower going ""up and down again"".
She said: ""It may be we can even get it done sooner.
""What we are being told is the minimum amount of time in terms of just getting the engine, the mechanics of it up and running and commissioned. 
""That would take us to the beginning of March.""
Ms Willingham - who was in the BBC Two show Dragon's Den in 2015 and 2016 - says she will be refurbishing the tourist attraction even after opening.
She added: ""We will just keep opening piecemeal - a bit at a time.""
Ms Willingham hinted the 531ft (162m) tower - where adult tickets previously cost £18.50  - may become more affordable. 
She said: ""I am adamant that this whole area will be used by locals, by my friends and locals that live here, [and] that pricing is done right.""
The Nightcap Ltd CEO says she wants to turn the bars and cafes at the site into a ""hub"" for Brighton residents and tourists alike. 
The deal will see 1% of i360 tower ticket sales revenue go to Brighton & Hove City Council.
She said the council is ""open"" to the Nightcap's input on how they spend the 1% revenue. 
Deputy council leader Jacob Taylor said despite historic issues, the purchase was ""good news"" for local businesses.
He said: ""You've got a huge structure, a huge attraction on the sea front. It is now going to be back operating, bringing in hundreds of thousands of visitors per year, helping those businesses.""
Sian Berry, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: ""This is great news for the local business owners who I know were worried about the potential for total demolition that was being discussed by some in the council, and I am excited to talk with the new owners about how we build up the positivity about this crucial area of our seafront.
""As things progress, it's important that the council is transparent about the sale and residents get full sight of the details, including the proportion of revenue the city will receive.""

The club's 'Pause for Thought' campaign urges people to think twice before posting online.

247,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2kd53rv2ro,2025-02-06,Questions over lack of emergency flood funding,"A local council has called on the government to provide emergency funding to help those affected by flooding on New Year's Day.
Businesses closed and hundreds of people had to leave their homes in Stockport after the 24-hour deluge when a major incident was declared.
Stockport Council has written an open letter to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) asking why emergency funding has not been activated to help them provide relief.
In response a DEFA spokesperson said the government planned to invest £2.4bn to build and maintain flood defences across the country.
The government's Flood Recovery Framework scheme can provide grants to households and businesses that are impacted by flooding.
However, the support was not triggered after the New Year's Day floods in Stockport, leading local leaders to question why.
Around 400 residents at Meadow Mill, near Stockport town centre, had to leave their homes when the River Tame burst its banks.
There was also localised flooding in Cheadle Hulme, Bramhall and Gatley.
River levels on the Mersey were the highest in 66 years of records and the peak in Stockport was more than a 50cm (19in) above previous records set in 1973.
Mark Hunter, the Liberal Democrat leader of Stockport Council, said the recovery funds ""existed precisely"" for the reason of supporting those whose lives were disrupted by the ""unprecedented rainfall"".
""There are still plenty of people who have not been able to return to their homes because they are uninhabitable,"" he said. 
Mr Hunter told BBC Radio Manchester: ""All we're asking for is some assistance towards the costs that people have incurred, whether it be temporary accommodation or furniture ruined, whatever it is.
""There is no reasonable reason why people should be out of pocket directly, when this emergency fund exists precisely for that reason.""

248,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge705zvdjlo,2025-02-07,Energy bill rise means people choosing heat or food,"The number of people seeking help with their energy bills has increased dramatically, according to Citizens Advice.
During the 2023-24 financial year the charity dealt with 8,302 contacts over energy issues, compared to an annual average of about 900 before 2021.
Fraser Gleave from the charity's Reading office said energy bills and food bills were becoming ""really hard to pay"".
Adam Lee, who lives in the town, said after losing his job he was having to choose between heating or eating.
Mr Lee, 51, moved to Berkshire from Australia more than 10 years ago and said he was struggling to ""make ends meet"".
He lives in fully electric accommodation and he said paying his energy bills had completely deleted his savings.
""The cost of property and rental and then council tax rising with all those costs added up I've not been able to save up anything,"" he said.
""In Reading we have a lot of community fridges and safe spaces which are essential for me, and a lot of other people.""
""I consider myself to be luckier than many,"" he added.
Citizens Advice said the number of people asking for support with fuel debt during the past year was more than 1,656.
That is four-and-a-half times the yearly average of 370 people from 2017-2021.
The charity has warned that by March it estimates the number of people asking them for help will have increased five-fold since 2021.
Mr Gleave said energy prices started to climb just as many Covid-related cost of living support schemes came to an end and the mortgage crisis took hold.
He said: ""Enquiries to us then really increased through 2022 as the Ukraine crisis sent wholesale energy prices up by unprecedented levels.""
Mr Gleave said Citizens Advice was seeing ""more and more people in situations like Adam and worse as well unfortunately"".
""Increasingly we are hearing from people where all the cost of living pressures are just mounting up,"" he said.
""It's very difficult to cope with the numbers of people who need support.
""We definitely have more people approaching us, than we are able to help.""
He said they were also working with the energy redress scheme, which funds projects that support vulnerable energy customers, to provide more energy advice.

249,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9xlyxpvzxo,2025-02-08,Attacks families to meet PM in inquiry push,"The families of the three people fatally stabbed in Nottingham are to meet the prime minister next week to push for a judge-led statutory inquiry into the killings.
Valdo Calocane killed students Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, both 19, and caretaker Ian Coates, 65, before attempting to kill three other people in the city in June 2023.
A major review of Calocane's NHS care, released last Wednesday, set out in detail the contact he had with mental health services and highlighted failings in his care.
The victims' families will meet Sir Keir Starmer on Wednesday at Downing Street.
Mr Webber's mother Emma Webber said the families hoped the meeting would confirm that the promised inquiry had the ""teeth"" to make sure all those involved in Calocane's care leading up to the attack and those who investigated it were ""finally made to tell the truth"".
Radd Seiger, adviser to the families, said they had been invited to No 10 to discuss next steps.
Downing Street has said Sir Keir was committed to a judge-led inquiry and has not ruled out a public inquiry with full statutory powers.
Calocane was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order for manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility and attempted murder in January 2024.
Prosecutors accepted his not guilty pleas to murder after medical evidence showed he had paranoid schizophrenia.
The independent review, commissioned by NHS England, found the ""the system got it wrong"" with Calocane and this was ""not unique"" to his case.
It detailed two years of violent and disturbing behaviour, four hospital admissions between 2020 and 2022 and multiple contacts with community teams before he was discharged to his GP because of a lack of interaction with mental health services.
It also revealed Calocane was not forced to have long-lasting antipsychotic medication because he did not like needles.
Ms Webber said: ""It has been a long and traumatic battle for the families.
""But we are glad to finally have the opportunity to meet with the PM and senior cabinet ministers, in what we hope will be the moment we get confirmation that the already promised public inquiry is going to be statutory.
""Meaning that it has the teeth it needs to ensure all organisations, institutions and individuals involved in the care, treatment of Calocane, and the investigation and prosecution of his crimes, are finally made to tell the truth.
""It has to be a watershed moment in this country to hold those who fail to account, address miscarriages of justice and, crucially, bring in changes needed to keep the public safe and make sure this can never happen again.""
Mr Seiger said the inquiry must be a judge-led statutory inquiry where witnesses are compelled to attend to give evidence.
""The families will not stop in the name of their loved ones until a light is shone on exactly what went wrong at every step of the way that led to the killings in Nottingham, that those responsible are held fully to account, and that steps are taken once and for all to ensure atrocities like this never happen again,"" he added.

The virus was discovered at site near Market Weighton, Defra said.
A 3km (nearly two miles) protection zone and a 10km (six-mile) surveillance zone cordon have been put in place around the premises.
Defra said all the birds at the farm would be humanely culled.
It is the latest outbreak in the county of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus.
Since December, all poultry and other captive birds in affected parts of England have had to be kept indoors to prevent the spread of bird flu.
The virus – which affects poultry and wild birds – has been around for a century, usually flaring up in autumn and fading away in spring and summer.
It spreads through birds' droppings and saliva, or through contaminated feed and water.
Scientists say the risk to humans is low at present. 
Transmission from birds to humans is rare and there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission.

Rebecca Kirby died aged 31 after being hit by a car on Lowgate on 27 August 2021.
Plans include making the Old Town area a 20mph zone, installing a new crossing facility and widening footpaths on Market Place and Lowgate to reduce the width of the carriageway, making crossing easier.
The authority has launched a six-week engagement exercise for people and businesses to share their views on the changes. 
The council is also looking to remove the Wilberforce Drive zebra crossing and replace it with a pedestrian crossing with signals. 
The plans were developed in response to a request from the city's coroner following Ms Kirby's death.
Work is expected to start this summer, the council said. 
Councillor Mark Ieronimo said: ""When it comes to road safety, the council takes its responsibilities very seriously and is determined to improve the city's infrastructure to ensure the safety of pedestrians, motorists and all members of the travelling public.
""By reducing vehicle speeds, widening the footpaths and providing better crossing facilities, not only are we improving safety, but we are providing an accessible walking environment for everyone in the community.
There will be a drop-in session at Trinity Market on 20 February from 10:00 to 18:30 GMT where people will be able to view the plans and share their thoughts.

Businesses closed and hundreds of people had to leave their homes in Stockport after the 24-hour deluge when a major incident was declared.
Stockport Council has written an open letter to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) asking why emergency funding has not been activated to help them provide relief.
In response a DEFA spokesperson said the government planned to invest £2.4bn to build and maintain flood defences across the country.
The government's Flood Recovery Framework scheme can provide grants to households and businesses that are impacted by flooding.
However, the support was not triggered after the New Year's Day floods in Stockport, leading local leaders to question why.
Around 400 residents at Meadow Mill, near Stockport town centre, had to leave their homes when the River Tame burst its banks.
There was also localised flooding in Cheadle Hulme, Bramhall and Gatley.
River levels on the Mersey were the highest in 66 years of records and the peak in Stockport was more than a 50cm (19in) above previous records set in 1973.
Mark Hunter, the Liberal Democrat leader of Stockport Council, said the recovery funds ""existed precisely"" for the reason of supporting those whose lives were disrupted by the ""unprecedented rainfall"".
""There are still plenty of people who have not been able to return to their homes because they are uninhabitable,"" he said. 
Mr Hunter told BBC Radio Manchester: ""All we're asking for is some assistance towards the costs that people have incurred, whether it be temporary accommodation or furniture ruined, whatever it is.
""There is no reasonable reason why people should be out of pocket directly, when this emergency fund exists precisely for that reason."" 
""Our thoughts are with all those whose homes and businesses have been affected by the recent flooding, including those in Stockport,"" the DEFRA spokesperson said.
""We pay tribute to the emergency services and first responders across the country for their continuous and dedicated work to keep communities safe.""

Whitchurch Civic Centre has been closed since September 2023, after specialist engineers found reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) throughout the building. 
Shropshire Council, which owns the site, said the money would be spent installing a new roof and carrying out other repairs, although it hoped more money could be found from other sources to have the centre rebuilt.
Mayor of Whitchurch Andy Hall said he hoped further investment could be found to pay for a rebuild, although he was not aware of any external funding in the pipeline.
Council leaders will be asked at a cabinet meeting on 12 February to approve the £4m funding and to also agree to an urgent ""needs analysis"" so the building can be reconfigured to meet the needs of the community.
Following a consultation held last year, a working group made up of local councillors and officers was set up to consider the building's future. 
It  carried out a feasibility study into the two most popular options – to either repair or replace the centre.
This work has also included looking at how the centre can be economically and efficiently run and managed in the future by Whitchurch Town Council.
Mr Hall said: ""At the moment we can't identify any money from central government or elsewhere. 
""But the civic centre is an ageing building, built on Victorian foundations, and some people will ask why Shropshire Council would spend £4m on a roof when you could rebuild it for £6m to £7m.""
The sports and market hall have remained open and are not impacted by Raac.
Dean Carroll, Shropshire Council's cabinet member for housing and assets, said: ""We know the importance of the civic centre to Whitchurch and to people who live in and around the town. 
""We're proposing to identify £4m of capital funding to help bring the centre back into use – whether this means a new roof or a complete rebuild will then depend on whether the working group and external partners can secure the additional government or other external funding that a rebuild would require.""

Amy Murphy began training in Newmarket, Suffolk, in 2016 and went on to work with 239 winners.
However, she will move her operation to Chantilly, across the English Channel, in a hope the business would be ""more successful"".
She will head off with 25 horses and her team in the coming days
""I've adored my time [in Newmarket],"" she told BBC Radio Suffolk.
""It's a great place to train racehorses, we're very lucky that we've got the facilities that we have and it's somewhere that I'll really miss, but we're on to new challenges.""
Asked why she had decided to make the move, Ms Murphy said France had better prize money levels.
""I've just found for the business model it's getting harder to makes ends meet,"" she added.
""I feel like I'm young and I'm ambitious, we need a new challenge on the business front to be a bit more successful.
""Prize money levels in France are incredibly good and that would be our biggest draw.
""Hopefully we can attract people that we wouldn't necessarily be able to attract in England when you're competing with the highest rank of trainers who are here in Newmarket and around the rest of the country.""
Last October, Gay Kelleway, the former owner of Queen Alexandra Stables in Exning near Newmarket, similarly left due to the expense and lack of prize money in the sport in the UK.
Ms Murphy said she still felt British horseracing was the ""best racing in the world"" and it could work for some people.
""Everybody has their own ideas on life, like with any business, and it's what works for you,"" she added.
The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Lisa Nandy, previously said the government took the horseracing industry ""incredibly seriously"" and was aware of the issues it faced.

Protesters climbed onto trucks, milk silos and loading bays while some glued themselves to the ground and chained themselves to fences.
Six people were convicted and a seventh pleaded guilty to charges at Worcester Crown Court at earlier hearings.
Muller plants in Gloucestershire and Somerset were also targeted as was Arla's milk factory in Buckinghamshire.

Costs for the four ranged from £200 to £1,200.
All four were ordered to each pay a victim surcharge of £114.

Officials say the earthquake's epicentre was about 20 miles (32.1km) north of Honduras and 130 miles (209.2km) south-west of the Cayman Islands when it struck on Saturday evening local time.
The US Tsunami Warning System had initially issued warnings to more than a dozen of countries - including waves of up to three metres (10ft). But, it later said the threat had passed.
Advisories were also issued by the Tsunami Warning System for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands following the earthquake - which were both also later cancelled.
The Cayman Islands government had warned residents of coastal areas to move inland in a message on its website.
It is unclear if there has been any movement or damage on land.
The quake was the biggest to hit the region since 2021, when a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
About three hours after the earthquake, US authorities warned that ""minor sea level fluctuations"" of up to 30cm (11.8 inches) could still occur, but that any serious threat had passed.
The USGS said large earthquakes at this location of the plate boundary are not unexpected.
In 2018 a 7.5-magnitude earthquake occurred nearby, causing some damage and a small tsunami, it said. 
""Luckily, the remote location of these earthquakes limits the potential for significant damage due to shaking,"" it added.

Max Vardy, from Farnham, was diagnosed with a glioblastoma tumour in June 2024 and, following six weeks of radiotherapy, is currently undergoing chemotherapy.
The trial will consist of having healthy cells compared with cancerous ones to look for unusually activated or repressed genes, which could one day be targeted with new or repurposed drugs.
The 24-year-old said the research gave people hope, ""even if not in time for me, then for the future generations that must fight this difficult to cure condition"".
""I have always been a very optimistic person. However, when I was told that my glioblastoma was terminal and that there are no curative treatments currently available, I was greatly saddened,"" he said.
The trial is conducted at the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence at Queen Mary University of London.
Silvia Marino, a professor of neuropathology at the university, said brain tumour cells had a different combination of genes that were turned on or off when compared to healthy brain cells.
She said the combination of genes were unique from patient to patient, which opens up the possibility of finding personalised treatment options.
Five people with suspected high-grade tumours are currently enrolled on the trial, but Brain Tumour Research said as many as 200 would be enrolled over the next five years.
According to the charity, the average survival time for the disease is 12 to 18 months.
Dan Knowles, chief executive of Brain Tumour Research, said: ""With continued investment into research for brain tumours, together we will find a cure.""

263,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy081v7xpwyo,2025-02-06,Child rapist jailed after DNA leads to conviction,"A rapist who denied repeated attacks on a teenage boy was convicted due to DNA found on clothing.
During his trial, Stewart Carlisle, 30, denied a series of sexual assaults over a five-month period.
But Nottinghamshire Police said the forensic evidence strongly supported key details of the victim's account.
Carlisle was found guilty of four counts of rape and five counts of sexual activity with a child, and on Friday was sentenced to 15 years in prison.
Officers said Carlisle was arrested in December after his victim reported the attacks - but claimed he had never had any sexual contact with the boy.
He had admitted aggravated-vehicle taking and was further found guilty of perverting the course of justice – charges that related to an attempt to coerce the victim into withdrawing the allegations.
During his sentencing at Derby Crown Court, Carlisle, formerly of Private Street, Newark, was added to the sex offenders register for life and handed a restraining order, forbidding any further contact with his victim.
Det Cons Richard Howe paid tribute to the teenager, adding: ""Like many young people in this situation, the victim in this case was initially reluctant to come forward for fear that he would not be believed.
""By telling a trusted adult about what had happened, he showed a great deal of bravery – as he has done throughout the legal process.
""Carlisle denied the allegations against him and appeared to gamble that we'd be unable to prove these allegations in court.
""However, thanks to some excellent forensic work, we were able to present very clear evidence to the jury that suggested previous sexual activity between the two.
""Carlisle's subsequent attempts to explain this evidence away were simply not credible, and I am pleased the jury agreed.
""He will now spend a very long time in prison, where he can no longer pose a threat to young people.""

264,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0lzegrpe3zo,2025-02-07,Child sex abuse survivors demand ring-fenced funding,"Survivors of childhood sexual abuse have demanded the government provide dedicated funding to ensure a much-delayed plan to tackle paedophiles is put into action.
The recommendations were made by Professor Alexis Jay in 2022, following her Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) investigation into grooming gangs in Rotherham.
""As of today, not a single one of those 20 recommendations is in place yet,"" said one survivor, Beverley Fenlon, although she welcomed Home Secretary Yvette Cooper's promise of a timetable by Easter saying ""we need progress reports and deadlines"".
Act on IICSA campaigners joined Rotherham's Labour MP Sarah Champion in Westminster to sign a letter to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer calling for the endemic child abuse in the UK to be treated as a ""national priority"".
Champion said she was pleased the government has committed to ""taking forward"" all 20 of Prof Jay's recommendations - but called for the government to ring-fence funding for each of them.
""We must keep the pressure on, to ensure transparency and accountability are embedded throughout this process, with every recommendation fully adopted, and victims and survivors at its centre,"" she said.
""Ring-fenced funding for IICSA is essential - ensuring the money cannot be segued into other government priorities, and to send a clear message that the government is serious about implementation.
""Victims and survivors have too often seen past government pledges never materialise, or the same money being double or treble counted, ring-fencing stops that and hopefully starts to rebuild trust in the system.""
The group of survivors were joined by nearly 100 MPs and peers in parliament pledging to work across party lines to tackle the issue rather than fruitlessly ""kicking it about"" in party political rows.
Beverley said she was left feeling ""frustrated and angry"" at recent political spats and another, Diane Ginn, said the years of arguing without action made her feel ""unheard and unrecognised"". 
Beverley added: ""We need to get this cross-party support in place instead of one party going after another because this is absolutely not a political football they can keep kicking about - these are our lives."" 
Supporting the calls, Prof Jay said: ""We know of the appalling and lifelong effects that child sexual abuse can have on people.  
""During IICSA, we set out what should be done to make sure children are better protected and now look forward to hearing the detail of the Government's timescale for delivering these recommendations, along with the necessary resourcing.""

Setting out his budget plan, council leader Mike Ross said the money would go towards funding pothole repairs, street cleaning and making communities safer.
It will be the third consecutive year that the council has increased the tax in the city by the maximum amount allowed without a public vote.
Local Government Association chair Louise Gittins previously said council finances remained ""extremely challenging"".
The budget proposal notes that 2% of the increase will be set aside for adult social care.
Ross said: ""After years of Hull feeling like a city that has been forgotten by those in Westminster, we want to do everything we can to make sure our home has a brighter future, and our communities get a fair deal.""
Under the proposals, more than £56m has been earmarked for fixing Hull's infrastructure, with £31m going towards bridges and almost £23m for repairing potholes.
Nearly £3m will help the council's plan for a ""cleaner and safer Hull"", with £1.5m reserved for bin collections.
The rise will also fund the Costello Playing Field development, new play equipment across the city and an expansion of the number of small green spaces.
The proposals will be discussed by the scrutiny committee on 14 February before a final decision is made by the full council at the end of the month.
""We have massive plans for our community high streets, the city centre and our cultural legacy and we're moving these plans forward now, so we can change our city for the better and deliver the fair deal people deserve,"" Ross said.

Earlier this week, the woman filed civil lawsuits in the US alleging the former couple violated laws on federal human trafficking, with complaints of assault, battery and inflicting emotional distress against Gaiman and negligence against Palmer. 
In a short post on Instagram, Palmer, who lives in the US, said she would not respond to specific allegations against her, but broadly denied them.
Gaiman has denied allegations of sexual misconduct made by eight women.
The lawsuits claim the woman was befriended by Palmer when she was 22 years old and homeless. She claims she had started working for the couple in New Zealand when the assaults began.
According to the lawsuits, she alleges that Gaiman sexually assaulted her and Palmer told her there had been previous complaints from more than a dozen different women.
On Instagram, Palmer, who is a member of band The Dresden Dolls, wrote: ""I thank you all deeply for continuing to respect my recent request for privacy as I navigate this extremely difficult moment. I must protect my young child and his right to privacy.
""With that as my priority, I will not respond to the specific allegations being made against me except to say that I deny the allegations and will respond in due course. My heart goes out to all survivors.""
On 13 January, Gaiman was reportedly accused of sexual misconduct by eight women, including four who previously spoke out in a New York Magazine article.
It led to publisher Dark Horse Comics cancelling upcoming work by Gaiman and a UK stage adaptation of his book Coraline has been pulled.
Gaiman, 64, has denied allegations of sexual misconduct made by eight women saying he has ""never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever"".
Palmer tied the knot with Gaiman in 2011 and they announced the birth of their son in 2015.
In a shared statement with Gaiman they revealed they were getting divorced in 2022.
""After many years of marriage, we have made the difficult decision to divorce,"" they said. 
""While we will no longer be partners in marriage, we will remain in one another's lives as co-parents committed to raising our wonderful son in a loving and compassionate environment.
""We deeply appreciate everyone respecting our family's privacy so we can focus on our son as we enter this new chapter in our lives.""

269,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2d323rnej9o,2025-02-07,Man with terminal brain tumour welcomes new trial,"A Surrey man with terminal brain cancer has welcomed a new medical treatment trial.
Max Vardy, from Farnham, was diagnosed with a glioblastoma tumour in June 2024 and, following six weeks of radiotherapy, is currently undergoing chemotherapy.
The trial will consist of having healthy cells compared with cancerous ones to look for unusually activated or repressed genes, which could one day be targeted with new or repurposed drugs.
The 24-year-old said the research gave people hope, ""even if not in time for me, then for the future generations that must fight this difficult to cure condition"".
""I have always been a very optimistic person. However, when I was told that my glioblastoma was terminal and that there are no curative treatments currently available, I was greatly saddened,"" he said.
The trial is conducted at the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence at Queen Mary University of London.
Silvia Marino, a professor of neuropathology at the university, said brain tumour cells had a different combination of genes that were turned on or off when compared to healthy brain cells.
She said the combination of genes were unique from patient to patient, which opens up the possibility of finding personalised treatment options.
Five people with suspected high-grade tumours are currently enrolled on the trial, but Brain Tumour Research said as many as 200 would be enrolled over the next five years.
According to the charity, the average survival time for the disease is 12 to 18 months.
Dan Knowles, chief executive of Brain Tumour Research, said: ""With continued investment into research for brain tumours, together we will find a cure.""

Leadbeater has tabled several amendments, including that in their first conversation with a patient doctors cannot raise assisted dying in isolation but must also set out other treatment, palliative or hospice care available. 
Under her proposals, doctors would also need to produce a detailed report on the patient, including an assessment of their mental capacity and any risk of coercion. 
Training on these issues would have to be provided, with experts in both capacity and coercion as well as the Equality and Human Rights Commission consulted before training is put in place. 
Leadbeater said she was conscious of advice from chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty that the system should not end up as a ""bureaucratic thicket"", which is too difficult for patients to navigate. 
""We need to give terminally ill people choice, autonomy and dignity whilst ensuring the most rigorous safeguards are embedded in the legislation,"" the MP for Spen Valley said.
""With that in mind, I believe this bill provides an opportunity to develop the very best end of life care, conversations and choice with 'gold standard' training.""
In a letter to MPs, Leadbeater wrote: ""It is extremely important to get the details of the legislation right, and enhance it where necessary, particularly with regard to safeguards, but we must also not lose sight of the fact that the current legal situation is unacceptable and deeply problematic, inflicting terrible injustices on terminally ill people and their families at their most vulnerable time.""
In evidence to MPs last week, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at disability charity Mencap, said how an initial conversation about assisted dying was conducted was ""potentially an extremely risky and dangerous moment for people with a learning disability who are terminally ill"".
He raised concerns that it could be ""highly suggestive and push people in a course that they don't, they may not want to go down"". 
He added that Mencap believes initial conversations would have to be ""incredibly well supported and structured"" with an advocate present.
MPs backed proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales in November, by a majority of 55. 
However, it will be debated further by the House of Commons and Lords later in the year, and will require the approval of both before it becomes law.
A committee of MPs is expected to begin line-by-line scrutiny of the bill on 11 February and further changes could be proposed.

Prince William travelled to Widnes in Cheshire to see the work done by Child Bereavement UK, of which he has been a patron since 2009.
The charity, which provides free, confidential bereavement support for children and young people, as well as families where a child has died, was launched in 1994 with support from William's mother Diana, Princess of Wales.
Executive manager Sue Randall said the prince has been involved since 2009 and that ""he's been brilliant as patron"". 

Speaking with the young people at the charity, Prince William asked whether they had found it hard to talk about how they had felt immediately after a bereavement.
Rebecca, 17, who lost her father, told him: ""I didn't really know how I felt because it was very sudden. Child Bereavement UK helped me direct the way I felt about it.""
The prince said it was ""crucial in the first few years particularly that people have support like this"".
""It gets you in a practice to know how to help yourself going forward,"" he said.
The teenagers made memory jars, filled with salt in colours which reminded them of their loved ones, as they spoke with the prince.
He also had a private meeting with bereaved parents during his time at the offices.
He then met staff, volunteers and fundraisers including 16-year-old boxer Clayton, who began fundraising for the charity after his coach Tommy Thompson used the service following his daughter's death.
Speaking after meeting the prince, Clayton said: ""He was a genuine person, very down to earth.
""Obviously he's been through the same situation as a lot of people so you can see when he does say he's glad of what we're doing, it's important because he knows what it's like for others.""

Mulberry Strategic Land (MSL) could soon submit a planning application for a 58-acre site north of Southend Road, in Corringham, Thurrock, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
MSL said the proposal would help ease housing shortages and create jobs.
But some are worried about the possible impact of the project. A post on social media claimed ""there is no thought for the current residents at all"".
The plan emerged after a request for Thurrock Council's opinion on whether an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) would be needed ahead of the application.
Planning officers concluded an EIA was not required, leaving the way open for detailed plans to be submitted.
MSL said the proposals would include a new primary school, a care home, a shop and a community centre.
In a report to planning officers, MSL said: ""The development will significantly enhance the local community in Thurrock by addressing housing shortages, providing essential educational and healthcare services, creating jobs, and promoting economic growth, while fostering a diverse and inclusive environment that supports the needs of all residents.""
MSL added there would be measures to reduce the scheme's impact on ecology and the landscape. 
In 2024, MSL faced criticism after suggesting Thurrock Council's planning committee had little choice to approve plans for up to 1,000 homes on green belt in East Tilbury.
It followed the Government's stated intention of building 1.5 million new homes and reviewing green belt policy.
MSL subsequently won an appeal to the planning inspectorate, leaving the council with an £87,000 legal bill.
A previous planning application by Cogent Land LLP for up to 750 homes on the Corringham site was withdrawn.

RBL Solar is set to apply to build a 40MW solar farm close to a Roman site at Richborough near Sandwich. 
The project - dubbed ""Little South Solar Farm"" - could supply enough low-carbon, renewable energy to power up to 40,000 homes, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. 
RBL Solar has been approached for a comment. 
An environmental impact assessment report submitted by RBL Solar to Dover District Council details the Roman ruins are about 75m (82 yards) from the proposed solar farm. 
The local authority is yet to decide whether the 87-football-pitch-sized site on a former landfill will go ahead. 
Richborough once had a large Roman fort, town, and amphitheatre.
It was the first permanent Roman settlement in Britain after the invasion by Emperor Claudian in 43 AD.
The wall of the fortress and amphitheatre remain visible on the site, managed by English Heritage.
""This part of the East Kent coastal area is fast losing its rural character,"" said local archaeologist Dr Tony Redding. 
""In a decade it will be a large industrial park.""
He claimed the ""massive"" solar farm would destroy the quality of life for thousands of people, degrade public values and destroy heritage. 
A larger 50MW solar farm was proposed near the ruins last year and is still awaiting approval. 
It attracted more than 700 objections.

The Break Charity said it was looking for mentors for ten youngsters in the area of King's Lynn, Norfolk. 
The mentors, who need to be over the age of 21, would be asked to commit to a year of supporting a young person with regular meetings, in which they can share life skills and try new activities. 
Maren Albrigtsen, the charity's mentoring lead, said, in particular, those leaving care at the age of 18 benefit from having positive and caring role models. 
Liam, 23, said the experience of having to leave his children's home on his 18th birthday was really challenging.
He was matched with his mentor, Mark, a year ago and he said it has been one of the best things he has ever done. 
""The one-to-one aspect of being with him really helps. [Mark] was a school teacher and now he works with children at an outdoor activity centre. 
""One thing I love about Mark is we both really love football. So it's much easier to start a conversation with him than with someone who doesn't like football.
""It's scary at first because you don't know the person. But now it's working really well for me."" 
After being matched with a young person, mentors will have supervised sessions with Break staff while everyone gets to know each other. 
Bianca Nelson is a volunteer mentor with the charity, which works across East Anglia. 
Ms Nelson said anyone who wants to do something useful with their spare time should think about applying. 
""We meet up monthly or every other month and do all sorts of things. 
""Sometimes we'd have a bit of lunch, perhaps doing something more practical, like a food shop, or there are even nicer things, like we just had a day out to Hunstanton.
""We went to the Sea Life Centre, got chips and ice cream because it was a special occasion, my mentees birthday"".
Ms Nelson said the young people supported by Break do not always have adults in their lives who they can rely on. 
""I'm very grateful for the upbringing that I had and I felt like I could bring something to a young person's life, offering them that constant support,"" she added.  
Ms Albrigtsen said they want to match the young people in the King's Lynn area as soon as possible. 
""We definitely want it to be a mutually beneficial relationship.
""After you are matched with a young person we do ask for a year commitment, because we want to give that young person the consistency.

297,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3912zl3ml2o,2025-02-06,First case of newer mpox variant detected in Ireland,"The first case of a newer, more spreadable variant of mpox has been detected in the Republic of Ireland, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has said. 
The Irish resident, who was infected with the Clade 1 variant, had recently returned from the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
The virus - formerly known as monkeypox - was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization last August.
The HSE said that while it is the first Irish case of the newer variant, it is not unexpected and the risk to the public remains low. 
The individual is now receiving specialist care in a hospital in Dublin.
The HSE added that those who have received two doses of the mpox vaccine, or previously had the virus, are considered to have protection against severe illness caused by the newer variant.
Director of National Health Protection Dr Éamonn O'Moore said the HSE is fully prepared to respond to this case.
""We have been working alongside international partners and National Health Protection has been monitoring mpox closely since the outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo first emerged,"" Dr O'Moore added.
Mpox is caused by a virus in the same family as smallpox but is usually much less harmful.
It spreads through direct contact with rashes, skin lesions or scabs caused by the virus, including during sexual contact, kissing, cuddling and other skin-to-skin contact.
There is also a risk from contact with bodily fluids; from contact with bedding or towels or clothing; and through close and prolonged face-to-face contact, such as talking, breathing, coughing and sneezing.
Common symptoms of mpox include flu-like symptoms, followed by a skin rash and pus-filled lesions which can last up to a month.
Once the fever breaks, a rash can develop. This can be extremely itchy or painful, often beginning on the face before spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.
In serious cases, lesions can attack the whole of the body, especially the mouth, eyes and genitals.
The rash goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off and can cause scarring.
In many cases the infection lasts between 14 and 21 days before clearing up on its own.
But mpox can be fatal, particularly for vulnerable groups - including small children.
Outbreaks can be controlled by preventing infections with vaccines, though these are usually only available for people at risk or those who have been in close contact with an infected person.
There are broadly two main types of mpox - Clade 1, which is often more serious, and Clade 2.
A previous mpox public health emergency, declared in 2022, was caused by the relatively mild Clade 2.
HSE said one case of Clade 1 has been detected in the Republic of Ireland. 
Cases of Clade 2 mpox in Ireland remain low, with eight cases reported to date in 2025. 
There were 25 cases of Clade 2 mpox confirmed in Ireland in 2024, 13 cases in 2023 and 227 cases in 2022.
Experts are now concerned about the Clade 1 virus that has been spreading quickly in west and central Africa since 2023.
Health officials experts have described it as  ""incredibly worrying"", and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreaks in Africa as ""a public health emergency of international concern"".
Millions of vaccines are being sent to the hardest-hit areas of east and central Africa to help control the outbreak.
Sweden, Germany, India, Thailand, Canada and the US have all seen imported cases of Clade 1b but there has been little onward spread to date.
On Tuesday, 12 new mpox vaccination sites opened across England.

298,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3wp51vpldo,2025-02-07,Charity boss describes 'gloomy picture' over NI rise,"A charity that supports the elderly says it may reduce its services in Leicestershire due to a projected £400,000 increase in its National Insurance payments.
Age UK runs day centres and shops across Leicester and the wider county but fears it will have to slash the services it provides to older people.
Tony Donovan, executive director for the charity in Leicestershire and Rutland, said it was a ""really gloomy picture"" and a lot of older people were worried ""because Age UK for them in a lifeline"".
A Treasury spokesperson said the government's tax regime for charities was ""among the most generous"" of any country in the world.
Describing the change to National Insurance rules, Mr Donovan told the BBC: ""It is massive. It's actually crippling us and we can't ignore it.
""We can't carry a deficit because if we carry a deficit, say of £450,000, £500,000 a year and perhaps rising, then ultimately the charity and other charities won't survive.""
He said if older people could not access the services, many would struggle with their mental and physical health.
The charity has a shop, cafe and runs classes at Clarence House in Leicester.
Mr Donovan said the cafe used to attract about 700 people a day, but now that figure was about 300, meaning a drop in income.
Sophie O'Connor, a dance teacher who runs one of the many Keep Fit classes there. said: ""It's extremely rewarding for them, but at the same time, it's nice for me to also see how beneficial it is to them guys.
""It does mean a lot to them.""
The increase in the levels of National Insurance contributions to be paid by charities was announced in the government's Autumn Budget.
A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We have protected small charities and businesses by more than doubling the Employment Allowance to £10,500, meaning more than half of them with NICs [National Insurance contributions] liabilities either gain or see no change next year.
""Charities will still be able to claim employer NICs reliefs including where eligible and are still exempt from business rates.""

Next month Cornwall's new household waste system will be rolled out to the final area, Mid West Cornwall, which includes Truro, Falmouth, Redruth and Camborne.
The new system sees food waste collected every week, while ""black bag"" rubbish  bins and recycling sacks and boxes are emptied on alternate weeks.
The council said recycling rates had already risen sharply under the new scheme.
The rollout started in January 2024 and was organised largely around the former district council areas.
The black 180-litre wheelie bins or seagull-proof sacks, together with the smaller green food waste bins, have become a familiar sight on Cornwall kerbsides.
The aim of the scheme was to reduce the amount of non-recyclable rubbish, and Cornwall Council's portfolio holder for Neighbourhoods Carol Mould was pleased the county's recycling rate had increased from 34% to 44% this year.
""Our recycling rates are going up very nicely and when we're finished we should be up to the 50% or 51% mark,"" she said.
""It is really interesting the amount of extra recycling we get, once people understand that you've got your bin, it does increase.
""It is absolutely fantastic, and also people realise just how much food waste they do chuck out, so hopefully it focuses everyone's mind to think 'hey ho, not so much waste'.""
But not everyone is a fan of the new household waste collection regime.
Penzance adopted the new system in July - one resident David Curnow said he was confused by the new rules.
""It's only my wife and myself and we struggle to get everything right, our black bag bins are rammed full,"" he complained.
""If they're collected fortnightly it will be putting people out of a job.""
Just down the road, Ian Inch said:  ""With fortnightly collections you haven't got a lot of choice but to recycle more.  I feel like we're being pushed into it.
""I'm getting used to food recycling bags but they do split and it all gets a bit stinky with bin juice.""
Lisa Colenso said:  ""It's OK. I like the food bins, we definitely chuck out less stuff because of it. It's better for the environment and less stuff goes to landfill.""  
And in St Ives there had been some criticism the council were slow to remove the old bins as the new ones were deployed.
Last to get the new service, the Mid West Cornwall area runs from Camborne in the west, to Probus in the east, Falmouth in the south and Perranporth in the north.
It contains 89,000 homes, way more than the average of 55,000 homes in the other four areas.
Cllr Carol Mould admitted it was the ""most challenging area"" but added: ""Hopefully the bumps in the road we found with the other four rollouts we can even out along here. ""
""It's a big challenge but when it's done, we're done, and Cornwall will be completely rolled out with food waste, and we will be firmly on our way.
""It really is a must that we must do.""
Cornwall Council has held a series of roadshows ahead of the Mid West Cornwall starting date in early March.

Rose Geggie, 20, and Rupert Jones, 19, both students at the Royal Agricultural University (RAU), have been given £3,000 by Kaleb Cooper after struggling to break into the industry from non-farming backgrounds.
The Clarkson's Farm star will also give the pair the chance to apply for a work placement with him or one of his industry partners.
Mr Cooper said previous bursary recipients had set aside the money to start their own businesses, and get special vehicle training.
Miss Geggie grew up in Cheshire, and worked as a shepherd in North Yorkshire for two years after leaving college.
""It was the best two years of my life, I loved it,"" she said.
She was drawn to agriculture through her passion for sheep and lambing, and has some ideas on what to spend her bursary on.
""I think I'm going to put it towards a sheepdog,"" she said.
""It means a lot, I'm over the moon. I'm very grateful to Kaleb for everything.""
Rupert Jones grew up in Bournemouth, and did not have any agricultural experience before university,
""I'd never stepped foot on a farm before,"" he said.
""I've always loved the idea of producing things and I've always grown vegetables at home and have animals, so coming here has been great.""
Mr Jones said receiving the bursary had given him ""a boost in inspiration"" to continue his studies.
""It really opens a lot of doors for me and I think it will definitely help me get into the industry.""

Many of the scenes from the period drama, based on bestselling books by Julia Quinn, have been filmed in the city.
Emma Freyling from Visit Bath said: ""The value to the local economy is about £5m, from the afternoon teas, walking tours and hotel stays all themed around Bridgerton.
""You can see beautiful Bath in the backdrop like The Royal Crescent, The Circus  and Great Pulteney Street,"" she added.
One of Bath's attractions that has seen a boost in visitors thanks to the period drama is The Bath Assembly Rooms.
""There's definitely an audience that come here as a result of Bridgerton,"" said Alana Wright, the visitor experience manager. 
""When they arrive, they often ask if they can see the room that was used in the programme and make a beeline to go straight there. 
""Lady Danbury's ball was filmed in our tea room and this is where Simon and Daphne meet for the very first time in season one,"" added Ms Wright.
The Theatre Royal has also seen an increase in fans looking to follow in the footsteps of actors like Jonathan Bailey, who played Anthony Bridgerton in all four seasons.
""Lots of customers come in and ask where they filmed,"" said George Miles, who works behind the box office.
 ""We tell them about St Johns Street and Beaufort Square, where I've seen stars of the show.
""It's got some beautiful story lines, a lot of it still relevant today and the show has done a brilliant job in producing good TV which is great for Bath.""
Emma Freyling from Visit Bath is confident the Bridgerton affect will continue to benefit the city, its traders and attractions.
""With nine seasons and books to go we hope that it'll draw in many visitors from all over the World, who'll come and see Bath and all the lovely locations featured in the series,"" she said.

302,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99yl5n0jp4o,2025-02-09,Martello tower history project needs volunteers,"Volunteers are being sought to take part in a coastal fort history project.
Recruits will help to conduct and gather research on Felixstowe's Martello Tower P in Suffolk which was built during the early 19th Century Napoleonic Wars as part of Britain's maritime defence strategy.
The project is part of ongoing work by East Suffolk Council and Suffolk Archives to ""breathe new life into the structure and elevate its status among the heritage landscape"".
The aim of the research is to create a historical timeline of the seafront structure  covering its 200-year lifespan.
Between 1805 and 1812 eight Martello towers - built to house rooftop cannon - on the Felixstowe peninsula as a defence against possible invasion by French forces. 
Their design was inspired by an ancient watch tower at Mortella Point in Corsica and the towers were named with letters of the alphabet, stretching from East Sussex to Suffolk.
Tower 'P' in Martello Park at the southern end of Felixstowe was built with about 750,000 bricks and cost approximately £2,000 to construct. 
At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, it was occupied by members of the Coastguard Service who kept watch for vessels suspected of smuggling and during World War One the building became a signal station intercepting secret German radio messages. 
Today the tower's lookout is one of the stations of the National Coastwatch Institution.

Research will begin in February and the project is due to be completed in October. 
Paul Wood, head of economic development and regeneration at East Suffolk Council, said: ""This is a brilliant opportunity for those invested in the rich history of Martello Tower P to be involved in this unique research project.
""It is a much-loved prominent landmark on the Felixstowe seafront and we are looking forward to working with Suffolk County Council in delivering this incredible project.""
Philip Faircloth-Mutton, county council cabinet member for environment, communities and equality, said: ""I'm pleased to see this great project that will help highlight the history of Martello Tower P. 
""We are excited to be working alongside East Suffolk Council to bring this fascinating landmark's story to life.""
No experience is required for the volunteering roles, as recruits will be provided with training and support, and applications via the Suffolk Archives website close 14 February.

The Hope Centre, in Northampton, has been running the event for over a decade and has raised more than £20,000 each year.
Participants in the event, which has the theme ""Cold and Unseen"", will sleep out for 12 hours with just a sleeping bag and a cardboard or plastic shelter.
Kyra Williams, from the Hope Centre, said: ""The sleep-out is so significant because it's a sign of solidarity – there's empathy and compassion built into it and without the sleep-out we wouldn't be able to support the numbers of people here today.""
Ahead of the fundraiser, a 50 year-old man, who asked not to be identified,  said the thought of where he would be without the charity ""terrifies"" him.
He told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) how he fell on hard times and turned to the Hope Centre for support.
He ended up sofa-surfing with friends for a year, after his marriage broke down and he was not able to work for health reasons.
At the start of the year, he began staying at the Hope Centre's winter night shelter.
""I've never had to ask for help but I had no other options; there was nowhere else for me to go,"" he said.
""Being here has kept me off the street - I've got a warm place, I've got a bed, but the biggest thing is you have got a support team here.
""This place wouldn't be here if it weren't for people going the extra mile.
""If you're willing to accept the help, they'll do whatever they can in their power to help you.""
Adam Brown, Conservative leader of West Northamptonshire Council (WNC), will be taking part in the event this year. 
He told the LDRS : ""It's an absolutely fantastic charity. It's not just about giving people a meal or making them comfortable on the streets, but also providing complete turnarounds in people's lives.
""I'm conscious of the fact that despite going out and being very cold for the night it will still be nowhere near the reality.
""But I think it's good to grasp those opportunities when they come along and get even a small insight.""

""It's a strenuous process,"" she said. ""You just have to put your best foot forward on all of those rounds.""
Ms Collins said she had always wanted to be on the show.

Ms Collins owns a fitness-orientated meal plan service, which she ran in Bristol for four years before moving to London.
She now plans to relaunch it in the capital.
""It's a tried and tested model, it was successful from the onset,"" she said.
The entrepreneur also trains as a body-builder at Trojan gym in Ashton Gate, Bristol.
""I do think having a business that resonates with my passion, it just set it up for success in the first instance,"" she said. 
Asked about what she had learned from being on the hit BBC show, Ms Collins said: ""You're taught to think on the spot very quickly, adapt to new situations and give it a best go - and be comfortable with whatever the result is.
""I'm definitely happy with what I've done so far.""
She said she was still friends with the other contestants.

If the proposals went ahead, more than £9m in government funding would be invested in the project, Leeds City Council said.
Proposals for the A61 focused on two junctions at Jumbles Lane and Carlton Lane,  WYCA said, with concerns raised about speeding cars and a lack of safe pedestrian crossings.
Planned B6481 improvements included a segregated cycle track from Thwaite Gate to junction 44 of the M1. 
Both routes would get wider pavements, footpaths and new traffic lights under the scheme. 
Drop-in events to share information about the proposals take place at Rodillian Academy in Lofthouse on 12 February between 18:30-21:00 GMT and at Hunslet Library on 18 February between 11:00-15:00 GMT.
The consultation closes on 10 March. 
Councillor Peter Carlill, deputy chair of WYCA's transport committee, said: ""These proposals will make it easier and safer for everyone to walk, wheel, cycle and use public transport on two busy routes. 
""I'd encourage people to have their say so that we can continue building a greener, better-connected West Yorkshire for all.""

It was the year 2000, and scientists onboard were forced to sit through the event - hoping and praying for the seas to calm down.
The vessel survived what researchers still believe were the biggest waves ever directly recorded in the open ocean, with the largest measuring more than 29m (95ft) high.
Prof Penny Holliday - then a student at the University of Southampton - who was onboard the ship, said it was an ""incredible experience"", adding that nobody on Discovery could ""afford to be afraid"".
Researchers onboard the ship had been studying the properties of the open ocean when conditions took a turn for the worse.
""The first week or so of the expedition the weather was fine. We got lots of nice work done - and then the winds really started to build,"" Prof Holliday told BBC Radio Solent.
""They built and built, and we ended up sitting for about five days hove to - which means you point the ship into the wind and the waves - waiting for the wind and the waves to calm down.""
On the evening of 8 February 2000, the ship was about 250km (155 miles) off the west coast of Scotland in an area of ocean called the Rockall Trough when the storm reached its peak.
Prof Holliday, who was studying for a PhD at the University of Southampton at the time, said the ""monster waves"" just kept ""growing and growing and the ship was all kind of closed down"".
""We couldn't do any work - it was really quite an incredible experience because the sound of the wind and the size of the waves was just extraordinary,"" she said.
""None of the people on board had ever seen anything quite like that,"" Prof Holliday said.
""We learned, unfortunately, why very few ships go out and collect data in the winter.""
People on board the ship were ""thrown around"" by the surges and some were hurt, but ""by and large"" people were ""just trying to stay safe and waiting for it to pass,  which it did eventually.""
Unable to get the information they had originally set out to acquire, the crew instead gathered data about the waves they had been battling.
Once back home, Prof Holliday and her team analysed the data and found that the waves had been the product of the fully-developed sea phenomena.
""Essentially, the waves were as big as they could get ever get under those wind conditions,"" she explained.
Researchers found that the swells had formed off the coast of the Canadian province of Newfoundland, more than 1,000km (621 miles) away from the Discovery.
Part of the team's work was subsequently used to improve forecasts for people working in the open ocean, and understanding when big storms - such as the one the Discovery encountered - will be coming through.
Prof Holliday, who is now chief scientist of the National Oceanography Centre, based in Southampton, said the story was ""great dinner party conversation"".
""I think it brings to life the reality of doing ocean science - you become quite insignificant in the big wide open ocean,"" she added.

George Buxton, from Yeovil, has been supported by Realise, which is part of the not-for-profit Somerset Care, since he left college in 2017.
With their help and encouragement, the 30-year-old secured volunteer roles in both his local library and a nearby charity shop - and has now started his first paid job at Somerset Care.
""I'm quite proud of my first-ever paid job,"" George said.
George has also built up a routine of going swimming at his local leisure centre, and meeting a friend for lunch.
When a paid job opportunity arose at Somerset Care to be an expert with lived experience for training staff, George applied – and got the job.
He now shares his lived experience as part of regular training sessions for colleagues across the group, and develops sections of the training course.
George said: ""When I first started working here, I'd never actually done that job in my life.
""The thing I found difficult was getting the bus to Taunton. I didn't know where Taunton was.
""Talking to people, at first it was difficult. With a little bit of help, I'm now getting a bit better at doing a presentation.""
Amanda Kingsley-Templar, who was one of the original members of George's support team at Realise, said: ""When I first met George in 2017, we spoke to him about what he wanted to achieve in life, what his goals were.
""He's really grown, his independence is much higher now. He's more confident and ultimately, less vulnerable.
""We are incredibly proud of how far he has come – and see even more great things ahead.""

Calls from homeowners and a care home in Etnam Street, Leominster, alerted Kit Hughes to the plight of the moggy who had been stuck up there 24 hours.
Mr Hughes, from Arrow Plant & Tool Hire, used a cherry picker and scaled a ladder with a cat crate and towel to get the mouser to safety. 
He said as he reached the roof the feline made its way towards him, so he grabbed it before it slipped.
Neighbours took the black and white kitty to a vet to check for a microchip and find the owner.
Mr Hughes said: ""We thought we'd do a good deed, drive up into town and get the cat down.""
He said: ""The cat had been up there for more than 24 hours so I think it was quite tired.""
Describing himself as ""not a cat person"", he said: ""It's safe and sound, alive and well.
""It's just amazing how it got up there - three storeys high. It was completely bamboozled.""
The company had hired out ladders and access platforms in the past to people who needed to get their own pets down from trees, he said, but had never been involved in a rescue before.
""It's nice just to do a bit of good and help someone out,"" he said. ""It's a bit different to the normal day job.""

The Whitworth Gallery in Manchester said it created the exhibition, which contains 71 prints from Turner's celebrated  Liber Studiorum collection, to encourage people to rethink his legacy as a master of oils and watercolours.
The gallery said it was the first time the entire set of the prints had been shown in more than 100 years. 
Exhibition curator Imogen Holmes-Roe said it was ""probably one of Turner's most ambitious print projects"", produced at the height of his career.
Ms Holmes-Roe said the works were being displayed together, as Turner intended.
The exhibition was ""exploring his genius as both painter and a master of printmaking"", a medium he pursued at a time when printmaking was regarded as secondary to painting, she said.
""Turner's prints are not just technical feats, they are emotional experiences,"" Ms Holmes-Roe said.
""With each engraving, Turner reimagined landscape - not just as a subject but as a language, using the print medium to evoke mood, atmosphere and scale.
""This exhibition is a celebration of that vision, offering a fresh, immersive look at a body of work that has too often been overshadowed by Turner's oils and watercolours.""
The prints have also been paired with some of Turner's famous watercolours and rarely seen paintings.
One oil work has been in the Whitworth's collection since 1922, but was only authenticated as a Turner in 2016, Ms Holmes-Roe said.
""It is very special to the Whitworth,"" she added.
""Very few people will have had access to it before now.""
Turner: In Light and Shade is on view at the Whitworth until 2 November.

The fire in a converted former stables block at the south east Cornwall estate created a plume of smoke which could be seen in Plymouth across the River Tamar.
Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service, which was called just after 16:00 GMT on Tuesday, said on arrival crews found the roof was well alight. Firefighters remain at the scene this morning.
Extra fire crews and equipment were deployed from Plymouth to help bring the blaze under control.
Firefighters said they were making good progress and no-one was believed to have been injured.
The cause of the fire is unknown.
Grade II listed Mount Edgcumbe House has Grade I listed gardens and the estate has more than 50 Grade II and II* listed structures.
The country park covers 865 acres of the Rame Peninsula and the house was built nearly 100 years before the Mayflower set sail from Plymouth to America in 1620.
The estate is now jointly owned by Cornwall Council and Plymouth City Council.
Dan Cox, who runs the Edgcumbe Arms at Cremyll said he believed damage had been caused to some holiday cottages and homes that people working on the estate live in.
He said: ""We have some spare rooms at the pub if anybody needs them, I think a lot of people have been moved to other cottages on the estate.
""Everybody is just in shock I think and pulling together this morning to see what we can do to try and make sure everybody's safe - we're devastated for those guys.""

319,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2egvp9vpkxo,2025-02-05,Council elections go ahead as authority confirmed,"Council elections in Lincolnshire will go ahead this year, the government has announced. 
Lincolnshire County Council (LCC) was among 16 local councils that asked to delay elections in light of the government's devolution agenda.
However, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner told MPs the area's elections would not be postponed and will take place on 1 May.
The announcement comes as the new Greater Lincolnshire Combined County Authority (GLCCA) was confirmed as an official body.
The government plans to scrap the county's two-tier system and replace it with a unitary authority. 
""Councillors of all types, including district councillors, tell me the two-tier system isn't working,"" Rayner said.
She added: ""New unitary structures will be the right size to achieve efficiencies, improve capacity and withstand financial shocks.""
Councillor Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association, said the announcement would ""remove the uncertainty for local areas affected"".
Last month, Leader of LCC, Martin Hill OBE, said it may not be a ""sensible use of taxpayer money"" if the government decided to proceed with the local elections this year.
However, Rayner said the bar for postponing elections was ""very high"" and she had only agreed to half the requests from councils. LCC was not among them. 
On Wednesday, the government announcement legislation had come into force establishing the GLCCA which will take on powers over transport, adult education and housing.
A directly elected mayor will oversee the newly devolved functions, with mayoral elections taking place in May. 
The transfer of power includes an investment package of £720m over 30 years with a one-off capital investment of £28.4m to invest in the county. 
Hill said: ""I firmly believe that decisions that affect local people should be taken locally and the benefits of devolution mean that we will be in charge of our own future in Greater Lincolnshire.""
The first meeting of the new authority's board is due to take place in early March.

Matthew Bell, 53, who taught at Sandhurst School in Berkshire, was previously given a warning after an investigation found he touched a boy's leg and carried out ""physiotherapy-style stretches"".
The panel found he invited another boy into school to practise athletics and placed a hand near the boy's groin.
In a statement, he admitted his behaviour was ""inappropriate and not in keeping with being a teacher and role model to students"" but denied it was sexually motivated.
But the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) panel said it could find ""no plausible innocent explanation"" for touching the second boy, especially near or on the groin.
It said it was also ""concerned"" about the ""secret nature"" of the arrangements when Mr Bell asked the pupil to meet him ""at the back door of the gym"".
As a result, there was no record of the boy being at the school that day.
Mr Bell joined the school in 1996 but was dismissed by the school, which referred him to the TRA. 
""As a teacher I did attend safeguarding courses as part of professional development but did not adhere to them as I should have done so,"" Mr Bell said in his statement in December.
""This was wrong and as an experienced teacher I should have known better.""
Mr Bell was also found to have offered pupils his personal mobile phone number but had denied doing so.
The TRA panel said his behaviour was deliberate and because of the seriousness of the allegations proved against him, he will not be able to apply to have his registration restored later.
Sandhurst School was approached to comment.

Rail maintenance firm Wabtec, which employs about 300 people at its factory in Hexthorpe, said it had entered a period of consultation with staff over the proposals.
The US-owned company said the decision was made after a ""comprehensive review of the product lines and cost challenges"" at the depot.
It added that several options were under consideration, including moving to another UK location or relocating to a nearby site.
Doncaster Central MP Sally Jameson said the council was ""supporting the company's leadership with suitable site options in the city"".
The BBC has contacted the local authority for comment.
The workers in Doncaster maintain and repair rail stock, including carriages and wheels.
Jameson described the announcement as ""a continuation of sad news at the site following voluntary redundancies in 2020"".
Should it close, Wabtec said it would complete its current projects, ""then withdraw from the vehicle maintenance market in the UK and close the site"".
A company spokesperson said work at the Doncaster site would continue ""well into 2026"".
It said a consultation would begin in the coming weeks.
""Work will continue on all current projects at the Doncaster site, and we remain focused on delivering our customer commitments.""
Doncaster Mayor Ros Jones previously described the city as a ""national rail hub"", with more than 50 rail-related companies based there, according to the council.

Most are based in the same building in Norwich as Green Jellyfish, where HMRC officers executed warrants last September.
Eleven people across the country were arrested on suspicion of tax relief fraud.
The director, 44-year-old Daniel Mark Robinson, did not respond when asked for comment. 
The BBC has seen letters and documents sent by the proposed liquidators, Quantuma, to creditors of the companies in question.
They state the companies have the same sole director and shareholder, Mr Robinson. 
They are: AS R&D Ltd, Aston Berry Ltd, Glide Business Solutions Ltd, Herasmart Ltd, Impact Business Shared Services Ltd, Joseph Business Associates Ltd, Macadam and Grant Ltd, Purple Panda Services Ltd, and Rogerhopkins Ltd based at the Union Building in Norwich.
Two other companies, Centralised Sales Leadership Ltd and Morgan Woods Ltd, are registered at Fen Ditton in Cambridgeshire.
Another, Toucan Blue Ltd, is located opposite the Union Building on Rose Lane in Norwich. 
An undisclosed number of people have lost their jobs.
Green Jellyfish provided consultancy services to companies wanting to claim R&D tax relief.
According to Companies House, its name was changed in 2023 to GJ2020 Ltd.
The letters stated GJ2020 had also gone into administration. 
Administration is when efforts are made to save a company while liquidation is a process that ends a company, while seeking payment for creditors.
The BBC revealed how Green Jellyfish and another company, Kirby and Haslam, were targeted in an early morning raid by HMRC officers.
At the time, spokesmen for both companies said they had ""nothing to hide"". 
Paul Rosser, a tax consultant based in Suffolk, has been monitoring Green Jellyfish's activities for a number of years.
He told the BBC: ""Having companies wound up in this way is fairly normal, however as some of the companies in the Green Jellyfish group were raided last year on suspicion of tax fraud, resulting in 11 arrests, we would have expected HMRC to appoint their own insolvency practitioner."" 
He said this was to ""ensure any evidence is preserved and to also give them a better understanding of the financial relationships between the various different companies in the Green Jellyfish group"".
A spokesman for HMRC said: ""We cannot comment on identifiable taxpayers or businesses."" 
A former employee of Impact Business Shared Services Ltd  (IBSS), who did not wish to be identified, said they were among those owed money.
""Everyone at IBSS was let go without their final month's pay,"" the former worker said.
""We're all out of pocket by a few thousand pounds.""
Employee back pay totalling £156,700 is listed in the documents as ""unsecured non-preferential claims"".
""After secured and preferential creditors - usually banks and HMRC - and any fees for the liquidator are paid, whatever is left is distributed among the remaining, unsecured, non-preferential creditors,"" Mr Rosser said. 
The bulk of IBSS's creditors, who are owed £2.9m in total, were companies within the same group. 
Total debts for all 12 companies are currently unknown. 
At the time of the HMRC raid, a spokesman for Green Jellyfish said in a statement: ""We understand that HMRC has a job to do, and we are fully cooperating and supporting them with the investigation, as we have nothing to hide.""
A spokesman for Kirby and Haslam said: ""We welcome the investigation from HMRC and understand they have to look into all claims made.
""We have been and will continue to be fully cooperative as we have nothing to hide,"" they added.

A Napoleonic fort, railway project and Windrush exhibition were among the five initiatives from Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk to benefit.
Duncan Wilson from Historic England said the awardees ""shine a light on the stories of local, working class people and their extraordinary contributions to history"".
The group's Everyday Heritage programme, set up in 2022, showcases the diversity of English history.
It wanted to ensure more people were aware of the ""overlooked historic places on their doorstep"".
More than 100 projects across England have received funding so far.
The Anglo Asiatic Arts and Heritage Alliance was awarded £10,800 for its plans to document memories of the Windrush generation.
Those involved wanted to speak to people from Caribbean communities and record their recollections for use in Thurrock Museum, Essex, and in a travelling museum.
More than 1,000 passengers from the Caribbean arrived on English shores when HMT Empire Windrush docked in Tilbury in 1948.
Caribbean co-director Alan Bright said: ""This is so important for us because it is the first oral history of this community in Thurrock and an important opportunity for their voices to be heard.""
Elsewhere in Essex, £13,000 was granted to help fund an art exhibition at the Jaywick Martello Tower.
The money would help to amplify the village's ""unique and vibrant seaside heritage"", according to tower assistant Lelia Ferro.
A project bringing together documents, artwork and memorabilia about the railway heritage of Melton Constable, Norfolk, was awarded £23,500.
The village was a hub of the Midlands and Great Northern Railway from 1800 until its decline 164 years later.
""This is important to our community because the story of Melton Constable will be new to many people who have moved into the area,"" said the Reverend Trudie Morris, of Briston Parochial Church Council.
The Holiday Makers, which has been trying to preserve the history of Hemsby as one of Norfolk's premier holiday resorts, was also handed £23,700.
The group has been focused on the former Pontins park, which accommodated up to 2,440 guests before its closure in 2009.
Project manager Sophie Little said: ""We hope The Holiday Makers unites the vibrant community in celebrating the joy Hemsby has brought to so many people over the years.""
Five musicians who specialise in working with lonely and isolated elderly people were also granted £9,900.
The group, called The Tale Collectors, plan to use the money to create an hour-long performance on everyday life in the Suffolk town of Bungay.
Group chairwoman Caroline Speca said it was vital for those who were lonely ""to have their voice heard"".

FolkEast had been held at the Glemham Hall estate near Woodbridge in Suffolk, for the past 12 years, but this year's festival in August will be staged 20 miles away at the Sotterley Estate, near Beccles.
Among the first names to be announced are Kathryn Tickell & The Darkening who will perform on the Saturday night. 
Tickell, who plays the Northumbrian pipes, has twice been named Musician of the Year at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards and was appointed OBE and awarded a Queen's Medal for Music for her outstanding contribution to the British music scene. 
Also announced for the 2025 line-up are: Penguin Café, Sheelanagig, The Liverpool Shanty Kings, The Longest Johns, The Rheingans Sisters, Tarren, Katie Spencer and the duo Jimmy Aldridge and Sid Goldsmith.
The festival is organised by husband-and-wife team Becky and John Marshall-Potter, who began FolkEast in 2012 at Somerleyton Hall, near Lowestoft, before it moved to Glemham Hall. 
When the Glemham estate was put up for sale last year, a new venue had to be found.
Mr Marshall-Potter said: ""Moving an event from a long-standing established site to a new and unfamiliar location is always going to be a challenge. You almost have to forget everything you have done and start again.
""Of course we will be transferring all of the popular main elements and ethos of FolkEast amd all the things people have told us they love, but it's a new geographical environment where things aren't necessarily going to fit and interact in the same way.
""So it's a learning curve but also an opportunity to be creative at a particularly striking site and we look forward to putting the FolkEast stamp on it to carry the festival's story forward.""

Sean Cooney, from the multi-award winning folk act The Young'uns, said: ""We've been proud patrons of FolkEast for many years and are thrilled at this exciting new chapter. 
""In these dampening times for festivals across the country, FolkEast continues to shine its light.""
Tom Brown, chief executive at the Sotterley Estate, said: ""Everyone at Sotterley Estate and the Barne family are incredibly excited to be working alongside FolkEast. 
""We know and have seen for ourselves what a special and unique festival this is and can understand why so many people already love it.
""The festival is such a great fit for us and we are keen for many new people to discover what a unique and amazing place Sotterley Park is, as well as offering many people in our community the opportunity to discover FolkEast.""
The festival will include five stages and three pubs and will be held 15-17 August.

Twenty animals, including racehorses, were found in ""horrific conditions"" in a lorry at the Port of Dover in December, seven months after the ban on live exports. 
World Horse Welfare (WHW), which is based in Snetterton, Norfolk, said it was caring for eight surviving horses, including a pregnant mare and foals. Five Irish Thoroughbreds had to be euthanised. 
""It was an incredibly sad sight to see this very mixed group of horses, some of which were fully clipped and shod, so previously well cared for, now looking bewildered, poor and depressed, with vacant expressions,"" said WHW field officer Rebecca Carter. 
Many of the horses were too sick and weak to travel and were crammed into an unsuitable lorry where one foal was on the floor and unable to get back on its feet, the charity added.
Port officials - who have been praised by WHW for their vigilance - redirected the lorry to a holding yard for further checks.
""I was faced with a heartbreaking scene,"" explained Ms Carter.
""The equines were so still and quiet and appeared shell-shocked from their ordeal.
""A number of the horses were underweight and had strangles, a highly contagious bacterial and potentially fatal infection – with the infected horses suffering from painful abscesses and fever.""
Two of the animals had pneumonia, some were suffering from skin conditions and various health issues, and unhandled foals were matted with faeces, she added.
""They were completely terrified and when I approached them, they buried their heads into each other and huddled together in a corner of the stable.""
Two Irish Thoroughbreds are recovering and are expected to be rehomed and seven horses in better health were claimed by their owners.
The discovery was made one year after WFW helped rescue 26 horses, including pregnant mares, which had been crammed into a transporter at Dover. 
WHW chief executive Roly Owers said: ""We always knew that the passing of the Animal Welfare (Live Exports) Act 2024, whilst a huge step forward, was never going to work in isolation. 
""Nevertheless, it is shocking to have been involved in another high-profile rescue of equines at Dover, many of whom were very likely being exported for slaughter.""
He said the welfare of transported equines would ""never be fully protected"" without a digital identification and traceability system. 
An investigation into the transportation of the 20 horses, which originated in Ireland, is ongoing.
A spokesperson from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs said that the government did not comment on individual cases, but added: ""It is illegal to export horses for slaughter under the Animal Welfare (Livestock Exports) Act 2024.
""We have put in place measures to ensure this law is enforced robustly.""

Independent charity Suffolk Libraries has run the service since August 2012 which now has 45 locations.
The contract with the Conservative-run county council is due to run out on 31 May and a renewal deal has not yet been agreed.
Andrew Stringer, leader of the Greens, Liberal Democrats and independents at the county council, said the group hoped the deal would be concluded soon.
""We have concerns time is slipping away,"" he told the BBC.
""[We have] consistently asked for updates and though the updates have come, [the county council] have just been a holding position.""
In late 2023, the county council launched a public consultation to seek views on what residents wanted from the service once the Suffolk Libraries contract ran out.
It said it would undertake a ""competitive procurement process ahead of offering a new contract"" that was expected to be worth about £80m over 12 years. 
The contract would initially be awarded to cover six years with the option to extend for a further six.
A spokesperson said the council wanted the ""most advantageous provider"" and to ""ensure value for money for the taxpayer"".
The new deal was due to be awarded in November, but in December the council withdrew from the official procurement process.
The council is still in discussions with Suffolk Libraries and is not speaking to any other organisations. 
Philip Faircloth-Mutton, the cabinet member for environment, communities and equality, said the council was ""disappointed"" it had not yet sorted the contract, as first reported by East Anglian Daily Times.
""This is because of difficulties in aligning bids with the service's requirements and budgets,"" he added.
""We understand how important these services are to residents, particularly those who rely on them for education, access to information, support and, of course, books.
""Our priority is and has always been to sustain and protect these vital services.""
He said an announcement on the contract should be made next month.
A spokesperson for Suffolk Libraries also confirmed it was still in ""active discussions"" with the council.
""Whilst these discussions are still ongoing we can't comment further,"" they added.

327,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2egp73lpelo,2025-02-09,Mother turns cancer experience into children's book,"A mother and teacher has used the life-changing experience of a cancer diagnosis to develop a children's book to help families deal with tough questions.
Priyanka Pandya-Bhatt, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, penned When Mummy Had Cancer as ""a tool, to have open conversations and help families"".
She said she was inspired by her daughters Keya, seven, and Shriyana, five, during those ""two very difficult years"" of treatment.
""My main focus was ensuring that the girls knew what was going on because I don't want them making up their own stories,"" she said. 
The 39-year-old was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer at the age of 36 and began writing the book while she underwent rounds of chemotherapy.
Mrs Pandya-Bhatt said she first discovered a lump in her breast at Easter 2022, which led to a mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and reconstructive surgery. 
By October 2023, she was ""given the all clear"" and was now in remission.
She said there had been plenty of advice for her and her husband Manoj Bhatt, but she felt her children were missing out.
""I thought, how much do you tell them, or don't tell them?"" she said.
""I think the questions that I've incorporated into this book would help any family in any situation.
""Children should know they're not alone.""
Lorna Russell, from Hope, a charity that supports young people aged five to 25 when a family member is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, said ""talking to children openly and honestly is really important as they can pick up on things really quickly"". 
""Whilst it's a conversation no parent wants to have, sitting down and letting the child know what's going on, and allowing them to ask questions about anything they don't understand, can help them feel like they have a bit more control in what is a really difficult situation for everyone,"" she said.
She said the charity had wellbeing advisers who young people could talk to and it was important ""to remind children it's OK to still do the things they enjoy, and to have fun"".
Mrs Pandya-Bhatt said her daughters were now ""a lot more confident"" and they ""saw themselves reflected in the book"".
""It's brought something very positive out of two very difficult years that were horrific,"" she said.
It has also led to her becoming a children's life coach.
She said that cancer was not always openly talked about in South Asian culture but  ""the community needs to come away from that"".
""I'd rather speak to my children and tell them everything that I know, which has come from a professional, from someone with a medical background, rather than them Googling or going to a smart speaker.""

A majority of member states, including the UK, Germany and France, said that the ICC was ""a vital pillar of the international justice system"".
Trump announced the sanctions after hosting Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - the first foreign leader to visit him since returning to power.
Last year, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza - which Israel denies - as well as a Hamas commander. The US has condemned the court's ""shameful moral equivalency"" between Israel and Hamas.
The US and Israel do not recognise the authority of the ICC, the only global court with powers to prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It has also previously launched investigations into US citizens.
The ICC counts 125 member states around the world, including the UK and many European nations.
The UK, France and Germany were among the 79 signatories to a joint statement issued on Friday to condemn Trump's executive order. Australia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Italy were among the absent.
Earlier on Friday, the ICC had called on its member states and global civil society to ""stand united for justice and fundamental human rights.""
It pledged to continue ""providing justice and hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities across the world"".
The ICC last year issued arrest warrants for US-allied Israeli leaders, and a Hamas commander, over the war in Gaza.
ICC prosecutors have said there are ""reasonable grounds"" to suggest Netanyahu, his former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas's Mohammed Deif - who was killed last year - bear ""criminal responsibility for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity"".
But a White House memo circulated on Thursday accused the ICC of creating a ""shameful moral equivalency"" between Hamas and Israel by issuing the warrants at the same time.
Trump's order said the ICC's recent actions ""set a dangerous precedent"" which threatened to  ""infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States"". It argued the ICC ""undermines"" the national security and foreign policy work of Washington and its allies.
The order also said the US and Israel ""are thriving democracies with militaries that strictly adhere to the laws of war"". 
The sanctions were announced while Netanyahu was on a visit to Washington.
The list of affected individuals has not yet been announced, but the sanctions could target people who work in ICC investigations. Sanctions could include financial and visa restrictions placed on individuals and their families.
The court's technical and IT operations - including evidence gathering - could also be affected. Observers have voiced fears that victims of alleged atrocities may hesitate to testify.
The court's inaugural chief prosecutor has told the BBC how the rest of the world responds will be most important.
""It's a challenge for the all the state parties - for all Europe, UK, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - are they going to let Mr Trump to become the global president?"" Luis Moreno Ocampo told the BBC Newshour programme. 
The UN has called for the measure to be reversed, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the ICC ""must be able to freely pursue the fight against global impunity"". 
But Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he ""strongly"" commended Trump's executive order.
He claimed the ICC's actions were ""immoral and have no legal basis"", accusing the court of not operating ""in accordance with international law"".
The US has repeatedly rejected any ICC jurisdiction over American officials or citizens, and has accused the court of placing constraints on Israel's right to self-defence, while ignoring Iran and anti-Israel groups. 
During his first term in office, Trump imposed sanctions on ICC officials who were investigating whether US forces had committed war crimes in Afghanistan.
This included a travel ban and asset freezes against former chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda.
Those sanctions were lifted by President Joe Biden's administration.
But during his last weeks in office, Biden also criticised the ICC's warrant for Netanyahu, calling the move ""outrageous"" and saying there was no equivalence between Israel and Hamas.
In response to efforts to what they described as attempts to challenge the ICC's authority, nine nations - including South Africa and Malaysia - launched the Hague Group last month in an effort to defend the court and its rulings.
Trump's signing of his latest executive order follows his announcement of a plan for the US to ""take over"" Gaza, resettle its Palestinian population and turn the territory into the ""Riviera of the Middle East"". 
After Arab leaders and the UN condemned the idea, the US president restated it on his Truth Social social media platform on Thursday. 
In recent years, the court has issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin over alleged war crimes in Ukraine, Taliban leaders for ""persecuting Afghan girls and women"" and Myanmar's military leader for crimes against the Rohingya Muslims.

Twenty animals, including racehorses, were found in ""horrific conditions"" in a lorry at the Port of Dover in December, seven months after the ban on live exports. 
World Horse Welfare (WHW), which is based in Snetterton, Norfolk, said it was caring for eight surviving horses, including a pregnant mare and foals. Five Irish Thoroughbreds had to be euthanised. 
""It was an incredibly sad sight to see this very mixed group of horses, some of which were fully clipped and shod, so previously well cared for, now looking bewildered, poor and depressed, with vacant expressions,"" said WHW field officer Rebecca Carter. 
Many of the horses were too sick and weak to travel and were crammed into an unsuitable lorry where one foal was on the floor and unable to get back on its feet, the charity added.
Port officials - who have been praised by WHW for their vigilance - redirected the lorry to a holding yard for further checks.
""I was faced with a heartbreaking scene,"" explained Ms Carter.
""The equines were so still and quiet and appeared shell-shocked from their ordeal.
""A number of the horses were underweight and had strangles, a highly contagious bacterial and potentially fatal infection – with the infected horses suffering from painful abscesses and fever.""
Two of the animals had pneumonia, some were suffering from skin conditions and various health issues, and unhandled foals were matted with faeces, she added.
""They were completely terrified and when I approached them, they buried their heads into each other and huddled together in a corner of the stable.""
Two Irish Thoroughbreds are recovering and are expected to be rehomed and seven horses in better health were claimed by their owners.
The discovery was made one year after WFW helped rescue 26 horses, including pregnant mares, which had been crammed into a transporter at Dover. 
WHW chief executive Roly Owers said: ""We always knew that the passing of the Animal Welfare (Live Exports) Act 2024, whilst a huge step forward, was never going to work in isolation. 
""Nevertheless, it is shocking to have been involved in another high-profile rescue of equines at Dover, many of whom were very likely being exported for slaughter.""
He said the welfare of transported equines would ""never be fully protected"" without a digital identification and traceability system. 
An investigation into the transportation of the 20 horses, which originated in Ireland, is ongoing.
A spokesperson from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs said that the government did not comment on individual cases, but added: ""It is illegal to export horses for slaughter under the Animal Welfare (Livestock Exports) Act 2024.
""We have put in place measures to ensure this law is enforced robustly.""

Independent charity Suffolk Libraries has run the service since August 2012 which now has 45 locations.
The contract with the Conservative-run county council is due to run out on 31 May and a renewal deal has not yet been agreed.
Andrew Stringer, leader of the Greens, Liberal Democrats and independents at the county council, said the group hoped the deal would be concluded soon.
""We have concerns time is slipping away,"" he told the BBC.
""[We have] consistently asked for updates and though the updates have come, [the county council] have just been a holding position.""
In late 2023, the county council launched a public consultation to seek views on what residents wanted from the service once the Suffolk Libraries contract ran out.
It said it would undertake a ""competitive procurement process ahead of offering a new contract"" that was expected to be worth about £80m over 12 years. 
The contract would initially be awarded to cover six years with the option to extend for a further six.

Political instability and security threats mean journalists work in a high-risk environment. They continue to be subjected to restrictions by the Palestinian Authority (PA), Hamas and Israel.
The media landscape is shaped by the conflict with IsraelÂ and the rivalry between the Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank, and Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip.
International watchdogs say the media environment is not free.

Yusuf Kayat, 54, from Dewsbury, was convicted at Leeds Crown Court of 17 offences, including unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 13 and indecent assault on a girl under 14.
The offending related to a child in the Dewsbury and Mirfield areas of West Yorkshire between 1989 and 1992 and began when the victim was just 10.
In addition to a 20-year prison sentence he was also given an additional year on extended licence.
Kayat was also convicted of aiding and abetting indecent assault on a girl under 16.
During his trial at Leeds Crown Court, it was revealed the offences started in cars and derelict buildings.
West Yorkshire Police said investigations into Kayat's offending began in 2021 when the victim was identified and spoken with.
Det Ch Insp Oliver Coates said: ""Kayat groomed and then committed some extremely serious sexual offences against the victim for a number of years.""
He praised the victim's courage in supporting the investigation into the ""appalling offences"" and for working with officers and the Crown Prosecution Service to bring him to court.
""Thanks to her bravery, this man has now been made to pay for what he did to her and will be in prison for a number of years to come,"" he said.

More than 2,700 homes were affected as a major incident was declared by Leicestershire County Council at the end of January 2024 in Ratby and Kirby Muxloe.
A burst water main flooded the system with a ""significant amount of water"" which took days to clear, Cadent Gas said.
The county council said the current work to make sure any final droplets of water are eliminated from the gas lines is to ensure residents do not have any additional supply issues.
Cadent worked to pump more than 21,997 gallons (100,000 litres) of water out of the gas pipes and provided more than 1,000 cookers and heating appliances for residents while the work took place.
Gas supplies were restored to all homes by 6 February.
Ozzy O'Shea, who represents Ratby on the county council, was personally affected by the outage.
O'Shea, the authority's cabinet member for highways and transport, said: ""This incident was awful for residents of Ratby and parts of Kirby Muxloe, but it was fantastic to see the community come together so quickly and so resolutely to support those in need.""
Richard Sansom, network director for Cadent in the East Midlands, said just half an egg cup of water can stop a gas network from working as it should.
He added:  ""To have so many homes and businesses without gas in the middle of winter is something we hope never happens, but unfortunately it did.
""I am incredibly proud of the work that we did to restore gas supplies in Ratby and Kirby Muxloe.
""But I am even more proud – and grateful – for the way that the local community rallied round in support of each other, and also in support of our engineers who worked around the clock to get the issue dealt with.""
A Severn Trent spokesperson said: ""A year has passed, and we'd like to say thank you for the community coming together as all the partners involved tackled what was a complex issue.""

334,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xq7d9dd45o,2025-02-06,Big demand for affordable lab-grown diamonds,"They have launched millions of marriages and are a symbol of timeless luxury.
But in recent years, the natural diamond industry has been rocked by the growing prominence of man-made, laboratory-grown diamonds. 
A fraction of the cost, the precious stones can be formed in days rather than billions of years, with backers also claiming they are greener. 
Sonny Jogia, managing director of Sonny's Jewellers and JQ Diamonds in Birmingham, said there was a ""big demand"" for affordable lab-grown fashion jewellery.
""There was massive reluctance from a lot of businesses around here initially,"" he said.
""I'm a third-generation jeweller, and for my father and grandfather, change wasn't good. When a disrupter enters the market the instinct is to steer clear.
""But these days there is disruption everywhere, and you need to adapt. If you don't adapt, you fall behind.""
Mr Jogia said he was one of the first shops in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter to invest heavily in laboratory-grown diamonds back in 2021.
Now he said it made up 40% of his diamond jewellery stock.
""People can change pieces more often and wear pieces to go with certain outfits,"" he explained.
""Natural diamonds aren't going extinct. They come with a story, and people still want that, but I believe the products will live side by side.""
Stanley's Jewellers is a family-run business dating back to the 1970s. Although some lab-grown diamonds are stocked, bosses have decided to focus on natural diamonds for the time being.
""We've always been a little more sceptical about how they are going to take off,"" said director Sam Batchelor.
""You just worry that it's all the rage and then all of a sudden... If they start saying 'Actually this is not what we thought... we're not going to buy them any more', you're stuck with all these stones.""
At Skydiamond in Stroud, Gloucestershire, they have been making diamonds since 2019.
Chief executive Madeleine Macey said they were ""optically and chemically identical"" to a diamond, and it was almost impossible to tell the difference between the two types.
""Natural diamonds are utterly beautiful, but, from a human perspective, it's difficult to properly trace where your stone came from - which mine, which hands it went through,"" she said.
""What we do know is the environmental factor of digging up the earth is a massive problem.""
However, the Natural Diamond Council, a not-for-profit organisation set up to promote the positive global impact of the industry, said lab-grown diamonds were not the answer.
""Most lab-grown diamonds are produced in India and China, and the electricity consumed for those comes from the grid,"" said chief executive David Kellie.
""What's really important is we protect the economies from where diamonds are recovered. A great example is Botswana. Their economy depends on them.""

Robina, who cares for her son who has psychosis, said being part of groups, including the one in Cirencester, had given her ""great strength and lots of fun"".
Kathy Holmes, a support worker, said even long-time carers were sometimes unaware of what help was available to them.
The group meets at Cirencester Baptist Church on the second Tuesday of every month between 13:00 and 15:00 GMT.
Alan, who facilitates the group, said caring for someone with an enduring mental health illness or complex emotional needs could leave someone feeling ""isolated"".
""We have speakers that come along, they talk to us about the different medications, what they can do for people with enduring mental health issues, and you won't be alone,"" he said.
""It will also provide you with a little bit of respite from caring for the person that you love, it's a couple of hours each month and you'll get a lot of information and a lot of friendliness and a lot of empathy from other members of the group.""
Robina, who lives near Cirencester, said her son first started struggling aged 14, and was now a ""very lovely, well man of 40"".
""I've been through different carers' groups, all of which have given me great strength and lots of fun knowing very nice people,"" she said.
""It's led to a path of friendships I mightn't have had with other groups of people, but then I've found many people who love playing tennis and walking like I do.
""Marvellous friendships, I couldn't choose better.""

Central Bedfordshire was hit by two instances of flooding, in January 2024, where people were evacuated from their homes, and September, where a month's worth of rainfall fell in 48 hours. 
The incidents cost Central Bedfordshire Council £1.158m, which included paying for emergency accommodation and contractors who worked to make highways safe again. 
A report into the flooding - which was commissioned in January 2024 - is due to be published by the end of February, after it was delayed due to the September flooding. 
The flooding was brought up in a Central Bedfordshire Council meeting on 30 January. 
John Baker, an Independent councillor, said: ""That expense doesn't cover the cost of officers who worked into evenings and at weekends, and went above and beyond to help residents and councillors.
""It doesn't cover the time invested by parish councillors and volunteers, but it gives me the chance to thank those who went out of their way to support people during those terrible floods."" 
However, the authority said it had not received any money from the government. 
Mr Baker said: ""It's very disappointing, but we're trying to make things better in our own budget with an additional proposed £150,000 for gully clearance to prevent some of the incidents we've seen taking place.
""That's our money, and certainly there's been nothing so far to replace the £1.158m."" 
The BBC has contacted the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for comment. 
In January, residents in Bedfordshire were evacuated from their homes after the River Ouzel in Leighton Buzzard rose to 1.88 metres (6ft) and the water levels at Clipstone Brook reached 2.31 metres (7.5ft). 
In September, the A421 was closed between the A6 at Bedford to the M1 junction 13 near Brogborough and Marston Moretaine and enough water to fill two Olympic sized swimming pools was pumped from the road. 
Adam Zerny, an Independent councillor on Central Bedfordshire Council, said: ""Following the January 2024 flooding, a report has been drafted.
""It isn't entirely the fault of officers. Ultimately we have to confer with the other risk management authorities, such as the Environment Agency and the (local) Internal Drainage Board.
""It was delayed somewhat by another major flood in September. Officers' attention was diverted to restricting the impact on residents.""

The blaze at the former printworks on Catherine Street, Crewe, during the summer disorder on 9 August was declared a major incident by firefighters.
James Evans, 19 and Justin Keeling, formerly Evans, 18, pleaded guilty to arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered during a trial at Chester Crown Court.
The pair were remanded into custody ahead of sentencing at the same court on 14 April.
A third man, Peter Lord, 20, from Crewe, was found not guilty of the same charge on Monday after a trial.
At an earlier hearing, Keeling also admitted perverting the course of justice.
Evans, of Welles Street, Sandbach, and Keeling, of Catherine Street in Crewe, went into the derelict industrial premises on 9 August and set fire to a large pile of cardboard, Cheshire Police said.
Firefighters fought to put out the blaze and were at the scene for several days with nearby residents forced to live elsewhere in leisure centres or with family and friends.
More than 350 people were affected and some houses were also damaged by the fire.
Det Sgt Ryan Ogden said some families have still not be able to return home.

Despite being one of the two men who caused the fire, the force said Keeling also spoke to the BBC in an interview after the blaze, when he said he had been left ""devastated"" and ""shocked"" by what had happened.
Keeling told police he saw the fire when he was walking back to Catherine Street with Evans and claimed he had seen some youths near the building, climbing over a gate.
The 18-year-old then admitted to a friend that he was inside the building with others and police were then told of this, with video footage on his phone showing a large amount of cardboard being set alight.
He later admitted perverting the course of justice for lying to police about the fake sighting of the youths, the force said.
Det Con Mike Edwards said the incident ""ripped residents out of the comfort of their own homes"" and caused a ""substantial strain"" on police.
""The fire also left officers with considerable health issues and caused them to have time off work,"" he said.

339,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgre63r354o,2025-02-05,"Letby victims already have the truth, says mother ","The mother of one of Lucy Letby's victims has said families ""already have the truth"" about what happened to their children.
The parent, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said the claim by a panel of international medical experts that Letby had not murdered any babies at the Countess of Chester Hospital was a ""publicity stunt"".
Panel chairman Dr Shoo Lee said they had new evidence about her case which was not meant to cause distress but give families ""comfort and assurance in knowing the truth about what really happened"".
But the mother of a baby boy, who Letby was convicted of attempting to murder, told the Daily Mail ""every aspect of what they are doing is so disrespectful, it is very upsetting"".
She added: ""They said the parents want to know the truth, but we've had the truth. We believe in the British justice system, we believe the jury made the right decision.
""We already have the truth and this panel of so-called experts don't speak for us.""
Letby, 35, is serving 15 whole-life orders after she was convicted of murdering seven infants and attempting to murder seven others between June 2015 and June 2016.
She lost two bids last year to challenge her convictions at the Court of Appeal.
The panel told a press conference on Tuesday they had found that deaths or injuries of the babies said to have been harmed by Letby were due either to bad medical care or natural causes.
Dr Lee, who co-authored a 1989 academic paper on air embolism in babies which featured prominently at Letby's first 10-month trial, went on to tell reporters that his team's work was ""not meant to cause more distress"" to the affected families.
He said: ""We know that they want to know the truth and that is why we are here to tell the truth.""
But the mother said it was ""misleading"" to suggest new evidence had been uncovered when such themes had already been examined at length before jurors.
Letby's barrister Mark McDonald denied at the conference he was merely submitting a ""rehash"" of the original defence case.
Mr McDonald said: ""The defence did not call an expert. So as a result all you were left with was the evidence of prosecution experts in relation to neonatology, paediatrics and pathology.
""So yes, this is fresh evidence, this is new evidence. It's compelling evidence because of the nature of the people who are giving that evidence and it wasn't heard by the jury.""
He also dismissed ""lesser circumstantial"" non-medical evidence presented at Letby's trial such as her handwritten note which stated: ""I am evil, I did this"", her hoarding of mementos of her crimes, and her Facebook searches of parents of her victims.
Mr McDonald said there was a ""valid explanation"" for each of them as he asserted Letby was convicted solely on the medical evidence which he said had now been ""demolished"".
Mr McDonald hopes the medical evidence uncovered by the expert panel - working pro bono - will lead to Letby's case being sent back to the Court of Appeal.
The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, has started to assess her case which is said to involve a ""significant volume of complicated evidence"".
The independent body said it was not possible at present to determine how long it will take to review the application from Letby's legal team.

The upgrade to Preston Circus Community Fire Station includes improved decontamination facilities and accommodation for firefighters, more sustainable heating and an accessible community room. 
The station had been temporarily relocated to Dyke Road in Brighton since February 2024, said East Sussex Fire & Rescue Service. 
Chief fire officer Mark Matthews, who opened the building on Monday, said ""a great deal of work"" had been carried out to ensure the project brought benefits for firefighters and staff, and also represented ""value for money for the community"".
The building, which serves Brighton and Hove and supports parts of Sussex, has been used by the fire service since 1901.
The station's curved facade was preserved during the renovation. 
Firefighters moved back into the London Road building in November, however the station has only become operational on Monday.

The benches were commissioned for the entrance to the Central Market at French Lane as part of a plan to develop Jersey's traditional markets.
The design was inspired by the architecture of the historic St Helier market building, which is home to nearly 40 independent traders. 
It follows a strategic market review in 2022 which said there was insufficient seating.
The report said: ""The market experience would be improved if more customer seating could be provided, both shared spaces as well as more seating internally and externally at kiosks.""
The benches were made by local collective Racc'moder from Holm Oak trees collected from a pile of timber at La Collette destroyed by Storm Ciarán in 2023.
Deputy Kirsten Morel, Minister for Sustainable Economic Development, pledged ""to enhance public-realm attractiveness"" in the government's Future Fit Retail Road Map, launched in December.
The government said: ""While these two benches may seem like a small addition, small things count in enhancing the environment of the place.""
It hoped extra seating would encourage islanders to stay at the market for longer.
Racc'moder's Xanthe Hamilton said: ""The design honours the beauty of Jersey's natural resources and a sustainable approach to production, making the most of our precious resources.
""We salvaged 70 tonnes of timber from the La Collette green waste site following the storm and invested in a mobile wood mill to make the most of our local timber.""

Amy Rowley-Jones, headteacher at Walderslade Primary School, discovered a logbook and a suitcase of old photos from as far back as 1906 in a school cupboard.
The relics document the experiences of former pupils during World War Two evacuations and disruption to the school day caused by regular air raids. 
""The logbook and photos have really brought the area to life for anyone who has taken a look,"" said Ms Rowley-Jones. 
The first entry in the diary is from 15 October, 1906, and is accompanied by photos of 41 children being admitted to the school on the first morning it opened.
Fast forward to World War Two we find entries detailing how children were evacuated to Faversham in 1939 and Monmouthshire in 1940.
If the struggles of war were not enough, it was recorded on one day in 1942 that 36 children were absent with measles, long before a vaccine for the illness had been found.
The logbook was first discovered by Ms Rowley-Jones in 2018 and is mainly kept under lock and key. But recently, closer inspections have revealed the plethora of information which is now being used by pupils in their education.
""It's lovely to link these in with anything we are doing here. It really makes you appreciate all we have here today,"" said Ms Rowley-Jones.

The 1944 blast at Catterick Bridge railway station happened as explosives were being transferred ahead of the D-Day landings.
Five serviceman and seven civilians were killed, with the blast scattering debris across miles and causing significant damage to the surrounding area.
Veteran Stephen Irvine, who spearheaded a campaign for the memorial, said he wanted a place for people to ""tip their hat"" to those who lost their lives to ""give us our freedom"". 
Houses, a cafe and the railway hotel were obliterated and a lorry driver who was in a hut more than 30ft (9.1m) away was reportedly blown off his feet in the explosion on 4 February.
Among the victims were five soldiers from the the Royal Pioneer Corps and Royal Army Ordnance Corps.
Some of those killed are commemorated at the Brompton-on-Swale War Memorial, but this is the first time 12 will be remembered together. 
Mr Irvine said most residents were not even aware the station had existed and had it had happened today it would be ""international news"". 
""I hope it will be a lasting memory for the Brompton-on-Swale community and for future generations to remember the fallen"", he said. 
Mr Irvine, who served with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, said he felt compelled to organise the tribute because he ""put himself in the soldiers' shoes and fully immersed himself into what was going through their minds"". 
""There was nothing left of them, just pieces of clothes with their names on them...and the innocent staff and passers-by caught up in it,"" he said.
""It really hit home what the lasting effect of losing loved ones is.""
Martin Reynolds, from the Brompton-on-Swale parish council, said: ""What happened is a very much unknown part of the history of the village, so it's very important to bring it into focus and remember it for the people that are still alive, who had had relatives who were affected by that explosion as well."" 
Richmond and Northallerton MP and former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak attended the event alongside senior personnel from Catterick Garrison and residents.

Grade II listed Yew Tree Hall in Lorton, Cumbria, was a former malting barn for Jennings, who brewed in the area for almost 200 years.
Chair of Yew Tree Hall management committee Adam Baker said it wanted to ""return the character and heritage"" and modernise the building the community had a ""love and deep feeling"" for.
A local architect has been appointed to start work on design options, following donations from members of the community. 
The 100ft (30m) by 20ft (6m) building was ""past its best"", Mr Baker said, but a ""well loved and used"" village hall.
Yew Tree Hall Management Committee and Lorton Parish Council hope to make the building accessible and reveal its historic features.
Teams have already been restoring the basement which had suffered years of neglect and flood damage.
""It was covered in sludge and silt,"" Mr Baker said.
Initial work exposed the original slate floor.
They also rediscovered the original fireplace and kiln.
Mr Baker said it would be ""fabulous to really open that up and let the community see it, because no-one's actually seen it"".
WK Design Architects would explore the feasibility of some of the renovation ideas, Mr Baker said.
The group has also announced a new fundraising initiative for the project called Friends of Yew Tree Hall.
The renovation plans align with the potential reopening of the Jennings brewery in Cockermouth this summer.

The GMB, Community and Unite unions said they met bosses from British Steel's Chinese owners Jingye Group this week.
The two furnaces have been earmarked for closure since 2023, with a plan to switch to more energy-efficient electric arc furnaces (EAF).
The unions presented their plan to maintain a two-blast-furnace operation throughout the transition to the EAFs.
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the GMB said British Steel had ""warmed"" to the plan, but needed the government to move on carbon.
The union's Charlotte Brumpton-Childs said: ""The multi-union plan means Scunthorpe having both blast furnaces open as the site transitions to low carbon steelmaking. 
""We believe that keeping the blast furnaces running is vital as it will reduce the risks of the transition and protect thousands of jobs.""
She added: ""For our plan to be viable, we need ministers to provide relief from these policy costs, just as other European countries have done. 
""Thousands of jobs and primary steelmaking cannot be lost because carbon costs rule out British Steel pursing a sensible and just transition to low carbon steelmaking.""
A British Steel spokesperson said: ""We are in ongoing discussions with the government about our decarbonisation plans and the future operations of our UK business. 
""While progress continues, no final decisions have been made.""
The initial plan involved shutting Scunthorpe's two blast furnaces and building EAFs at Scunthorpe and Teesside.
However, last month, Scunthorpe MP Sir Nic Dakin said he was ""quietly hopeful"" that both EAFs would be built in the town.
Unions claim the closure of the blast furnaces could see up to 2,000 jobs lost in North Lincolnshire.
A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said the government  ""will simply not allow the end of steel making in the UK"". 
""We're working across government in partnership with trade unions and businesses, including British Steel, to secure a green steel transition that's right for the workforce, represents a good investment for taxpayers and safeguards the future of the steel industry in Britain,"" they added.

In December, Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH), which runs QMC, committed to 45-minute handovers to free up ambulance crews to better respond to more emergencies.
This initiative has helped cut handover times at QMC's emergency department by 52 minutes from January 2024 to January this year.
East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) chief executive Richard Henderson said ""45 minutes should be a backstop and not a target"", with the national target set at 15 minutes.
Mr Henderson said: ""There is a real risk we could become focused on 45 minutes, and the constitutional time remains 15 minutes for a clinical handover, and we have got to really make sure we keep that momentum going.""
National guidance still says patients arriving at an emergency department by ambulance must be handed over to the care of staff within 15 minutes.
During an EMAS meeting on Tuesday, divisional director for Nottinghamshire Greg Cox said: ""Last winter, activity was higher, but nevertheless that is a significant gain.""
Mr Cox added: ""There is still some work to do, but it is a significant improvement and a clear correlation between handover times, delays and our ability to respond to our patients.""
The drop in handover delays has also led to better response times to calls in the community, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
At an NUH board meeting in January, Mark Simmonds, the trust's deputy medical director, said the pilot had negatively affected emergency department staff.
He said it had led to more incidences of ""corridor care"" – where patients end up waiting on beds in hospital corridors before admission.

CCTV footage broadcast by local media shows at least two men wearing balaclavas and carrying weapons at the entrance of Clémenceau station in the Belgian capital early on Wednesday.
Video from the scene shows an exchange of fire at about 06:15 local time (05:15 GMT).
Sarah Frederickx, spokeswoman for Brussels police, said the suspects may have fled into the tunnels of the metro system.
The spokeswoman said there were no injuries in the shooting.
Police are looking for ""a small group of people, probably two or three individuals"", Ms Frederickx said, adding that they may still be armed and that police did not want to take any risks. 
BruxellesToday reported the suspects were carrying what appeared to be Kalashnikov weapons. 
The BBC has verified footage of the incident circulating on social media, which showed two men brandishing what looked like rifles and shooting. From the video, it is unclear who they are aiming at.
Multiple metro stations closed for hours this morning and interrupted service at Clémenceau station and the nearby Brussels-Midi station, which also serves as a terminal for Eurostar trains. They have since reopened and lines are gradually returning to their usual service. 
A command post to coordinate the search has been set up at the Anderlecht town hall, west of the Belgian capital's city centre.
No arrests have been made yet and nobody was injured in the shooting, the prosecutor's office said in a recent update. They add that, at this time, authorities don't believe there was a ""terrorist"" motive behind the attack.
Belgium's interior minister, Bernard Quintin, joined police and Anderlecht's mayor at the town hall on Wednesday morning.
""We are following the situation closely,"" he said in a post on X.
Reports on Belgian media suggest the events might have been linked to drug trafficking. The area around Brussels-Midi has long had a reputation for violence and crime.
Tram lines that were disrupted - namely between Lemonnier and Berkendael and between Port d'Anderlecht and Gare du Midi stations - have now resumed service.
Thousands of commuters were impacted by the incident, which took place during the morning rush hour.
One local resident told Belgium's VRT broadcaster he heard five or six shots. Another resident, also unnamed by the broadcaster, said she was scared.
""I went outside and wondered what is happening. Is this war? We have to send our children to school, we take the metro. We are scared, yes.""
