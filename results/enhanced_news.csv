The nets at Center Parcs Longleat Forest in Wiltshire will be set on steel columns and connected to 3m-tall tree houses. 
Wiltshire Council approved the plans, with the nets set to be constructed on what is currently a golf course.
The application stated some of the rest of the golf course would be ""restored and planted with native species.""
Center Parcs' application said it was ""the ideal woodland setting for guests to embrace the natural environment"".
""This proposal has been thoughtfully designed to ensure the layout of the adventure nets structure and material choices are sympathetic to its surroundings, with minimal impact to the existing woodland environment, it added. 
The case officer report from the council agreed the intended high-level walkway would not look out of place, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. 
""The design is aimed at blending in with the trees and allowing guest users to more fully appreciate the surrounding trees,"" they said.
The council, which approved the plans on 23 January, said the project was a ""welcomed attraction to the holiday park"".
Plans also stated a crane would be used to carry out the work, but that visitors should see little disruption.

Some residents of Esh Winning, County Durham, said they had had little or no mobile signal since 13 January and there had been no warning about the disruption. 
Operator O2, which is used by Tesco Mobile, Giffgaff and Sky, confirmed it had been carrying out upgrades to a mast in the area.
It apologised for the disruption and said information was ""clearly communicated"" and regularly updated on its website.
One resident, who did not wish to be named, said the community was ""very upset and angry"" because no-one had been warned. 
The resident said not having signal had left them unable to receive text message reminders about upcoming hospital appointments.
According to O2's network status checker, the issues could last until 8 February. 
Ian Rees, who recently moved to the area, said he also started having signal issues on the same day, resulting in him nearly missing out on a job offer.
Signal since then had been sporadic, with no mobile data signal at all, he said.
""I'm OK now as I've figured out how to enable Wi-Fi calling,"" he said.
""I'm new-ish to the area so my main problem is trying to use any satnav apps to get me around.""
An O2 spokesperson said: ""We are carrying out planned upgrades to a mast in Esh Winning to ensure we continue to provide fast and reliable connectivity to customers in the area. 
""This may cause some short-term disruption and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.""
Vodafone, which is used by VOXI, Asda Mobile, Lebara, and Talkmobile, has also been affected. 
""Our infrastructure partner, who is responsible for the site, is carrying out essential upgrades which will support future technologies,"" it said.
The company apologised and encouraged customers to sign up to its network checker.
EE said its mobile network in the village was operating as normal.

Manager Omer Riza says more new signings before the end of the January transfer window will be ""massive"" for Cardiff City's season.
The Bluebirds have so far only added Yousef Salech this month, but the striker has already scored in Cardiff colours, a stoppage time equaliser at Millwall in his second appearance.
But Riza wants more new faces to help their fight against relegation in the Championship.
""Hopefully they'll be to or three more,"" he said.
""It all depends on the situation at the clubs, it depends on how quickly we can get things moving or done, but things are definitely moving towards the right direction.

Aleksandr Benga, 16, was last seen near a water wheel in the grounds of Stornoway's Lews Castle on the morning of 18 November.
The charity Specialist Search Dogs is to carry out searches around Stornoway this weekend.
Previous searches have involved police, divers, coastguard teams and mountain rescue volunteers.
The effort to find Aleksandr has included checks of outbuildings, including sheilings - which are small shelters crofters used in summer while tending livestock - in case he had sought shelter from cold weather.
On 25 November, police stopped drivers in Stornoway to ask if they had seen the teenager.
Aleksandr is described as 6ft 2ins tall, of slim build with short brown hair.
When he was last seen he was wearing a beige jumper and black jeans. He may also have a red jacket and a yellow beanie hat.

12,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zxeg53gxo,2025-01-23,"Comeback queens, blockbusters and Succession stars: Oscar nominations time","The Oscar nominations will be announced later, in an exciting year for the film awards race where there is no consensus frontrunner for best picture.
Blockbusters such as Wicked and Dune: Part Two will compete with Emilia Pérez, Conclave, A Complete Unknown, The Brutalist and Anora when the shortlists are released at 13:30 GMT. 
The nominations were due to be announced last week, but were postponed after the voting period was extended due to the Los Angeles wildfires.
The Academy Awards ceremony, hosted by US comic Conan O'Brien, will take place on 2 March.

There are two musicals, two massive pop stars, two Sebastian Stan films, two actors from Succession and several comeback queens in the race this year.
Here are a few things to look out for when the Academy announces its nominations.
Comeback narratives are strong this year, particularly in the best actress category where many contenders have returned after years away from the awards race.
One of the frontrunners is The Substance star Demi Moore, for playing a woman who swaps her body for a younger and more beautiful version of herself.
Equally, there is a huge amount of affection towards Pamela Anderson, who has already scored surprise SAG and Golden Globe nominations for her vulnerable and powerful performance in The Last Showgirl as an ageing Las Vegas performer.
Marianne Jean-Baptiste has an outside chance at a nomination for playing a constantly miserable woman in Mike Leigh's Hard Truths, nearly three decades after her first nomination for their previous collaboration Secrets & Lies.
Even Angelina Jolie arguably has a comeback narrative. Although she has remained in the spotlight in recent years, her portrayal of opera singer Maria Callas is her first Oscar contender for some time. She has lost momentum in recent weeks, however, after missing a nomination at other major ceremonies.
Over in the best actor category, Adrien Brody (The Brutalist) is expected to return to the race for his performance as a Hungarian architect hired by a wealthy American after World War Two. Brody was last nominated in 2003, when he won for The Pianist.
Other contenders include Timothée Chalamet (A Complete Unknown) for his portrayal as Bob Dylan in the early 1960s, and Colman Domingo (Sing Sing) for playing a prison inmate who takes part in an performing arts programme.
Possible British nominees include Ralph Fiennes (Conclave), for his role as a cardinal who oversees the selection of a new Pope, and Daniel Craig (Queer), who plays a gay man who ventures into the jungle in search of a plant with telepathic qualities.
Sebastian Stan has two possible chances for a nomination - one for playing a young Donald Trump in The Apprentice, and another for the Golden Globe-winning A Different Man, for his role as an aspiring actor who radically changes his appearance.
Two of the biggest pop stars of the last 15 years could be recognised in the best supporting actress category. Ariana Grande is a dead-cert for her performance in Wicked as Glinda, the Good Witch of the North.
Another possible (but less certain) nominee is Selena Gomez for her role in Spanish-language musical Emilia Pérez as the wife of a Mexican drug lord who changes gender. 
Her co-star Zoe Saldaña is the current frontrunner to win the category. She took home the Golden Globe earlier this month and has a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel films.
But it's a crowded category, with Felicity Jones (The Brutalist), Isabella Rossellini (Conclave), Monica Barbaro (A Complete Unknown) and Jamie Lee Curtis (The Last Showgirl) also in the running.
Danielle Deadwyler (The Piano Lesson), Margaret Qualley (The Substance) and Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor (Nickel Boys) could also show up. This category is particularly hard to predict due to different actresses being nominated at different precursor events.
The frontrunner in the best supporting actor category is Kieran Culkin, who is best known for his role as the snarky Roman Roy in HBO's Succession.
He could score a nomination for his performance in the excellent A Real Pain, about two cousins who travel across Poland in remembrance of their grandmother.
But one of Culkin's competitors is his own Succession co-star Jeremy Strong, who could be recognised for his terrific performance in The Apprentice as lawyer Roy Cohn, who mentored Donald Trump in his early years as a real estate tycoon.
The pair could be joined in the best supporting actor category by Yura Borisov (Anora), Guy Pearce (The Brutalist), Clarence Maclin (Sing Sing), and Edward Norton (A Complete Unknown).
And what about Culkin and Strong's on-screen sister Sarah Snook? Well, she has a film in the awards race too, although not in the acting categories. The Australian voices the main character in the beguiling animated film Memoir of a Snail.
Jolie, Moore, Anderson and Jean-Baptiste may have comeback narratives, but they are competing in a particularly crowded lead actress category this year.
Other frontrunners include Mikey Madison (Anora) for her barnstorming performance as a New York stripper who falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.
She could be joined by Cynthia Erivo (Wicked) for her role as the Wizard of Oz character Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West. The British actress is an Oscar win away from achieving EGOT status.
Golden Globe winner Fernanda Torres (I'm Still Here) could make it in for her understated portrayal of a Brazilian woman who investigates the disappearance of her congressman husband.
Karla Sofía Gascón (Emilia Pérez) is also likely to be recognised for playing a Mexican cartel leader who leaves the world of crime to live a new life as a trans woman.
Gascón would become the first trans person to be nominated in an acting category. There is one caveat - Elliot Page was nominated for Juno in 2008, but that was more than a decade before the actor transitioned. 
Robbie Williams had a good chance of an Oscar nomination this year thanks to Better Man, the biopic which sees him depicted as a CGI chimpanzee.
The singer made the 15-strong shortlist in the best original song category for his track Forbidden Road, taken from the film's soundtrack.
But sadly he will not be one of the final five nominees, after the song was disqualified for ""incorporating material from an existing song that was not written"" for the film.
It's understood Forbidden Road was considered too similar to I Got A Name, performed by Jim Croce in the 1973 film The Last American Hero.
Instead, songs from The Six Triple Eight, Challengers, The Wild Robot, Blitz and two numbers from Emilia Pérez could be nominated.
Established directors such as Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson often tend to populate this category, understandably cropping up at the Oscars again and again.
This year, however, all of the major contenders for best director would be first-time Oscar nominees.
Brady Corbet (The Brutalist), Edward Berger (Conclave), Jacques Audiard (Emilia Pérez) and Sean Baker (Anora) are all likely to be recognised.
They could be joined by Coralie Fargeat (The Substance), RaMell Ross (Nickel Boys)  and James Mangold (A Complete Unknown).
Even the less likely contenders, such as Jon M Chu (Wicked), Denis Villeneuve (Dune: Part Two), Mohammad Rasoulof (The Seed of the Sacred Fig) and Payal Kapadia (All We Imagine As Light), would be first-time nominees in the category.
We may not have Barbie this year, but there are plenty of other blockbusters which could show up at the Oscars.
Box office smashes in 2024 included Wicked, which almost certainly will be nominated for best picture, and Gladiator II, which almost certainly won't be.
Other sequels which cleaned up financially include Dune: Part Two, the second instalment of the sandy sci-fi adaptation, which is likely to be nominated for best picture as well as several technical prizes.
Elsewhere, Inside Out 2, the highest-grossing film of last year, will likely make the best animated film category, alongside the popular The Wild Robot.
But box office takings aren't everything. Both animated films could be beaten by a much smaller contender, the charming Latvian film Flow, about a cat who must work with other animals to survive after a flood, which won the Golden Globe.
Often with the Oscars, there is a clear best picture winner which steamrolls its way through awards season, such as Oppenheimer in 2024. This year, however, is wide open.
Different films have been winning prizes at the various events which precede the Oscars. There are six contenders which feasibly could take the top prize, depending on how the next few weeks shake out.
The Brutalist and Emilia Pérez won the two top film awards at the Golden Globes, and both have a lot of passionate supporters.
Meanwhile, Conclave and Anora are widely liked and less divisive than some other contenders, and could therefore benefit from the preferential ballot system, where voters rank the nominated films in order of preference.
Less likely but still possible winners include A Complete Unknown, which had a particularly strong showing at the SAG nominations, and Wicked, which is likely to be heavily nominated and is one of the most successful films financially.
Nominations will be announced at 13:30 GMT and will be streamed on the BBC News live page, as well as the Academy's official website and social channels.
The event has been scaled down due to the LA wildfires, and will now be made virtually without the usual audience of journalists.

13,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy08wrwnyy7o,2025-01-23,'End of era' as newspaper building demolished,"A newspaper office building has been demolished, marking the ""end of an era"" for a city, former staff have said.
Newspaper House, in Dalston Road, Carlisle, had been the home of Cumbrian Newspapers and its subsequent owner Newsquest, the publishers of the Cumberland News and News & Star, among others.
Towards the end of 2021, the press hall, which was situated at the rear of Newspaper House, was also demolished.
Jenny Barwise, who worked for the publisher for 13 years, said: ""It was a real hub of activity in its day and there was a real buzz in the newsroom, especially when a story broke - it's the end of an era."" 
Miss Barwise started work with the company first as a reporter and then as audience and content editor, leaving in 2020.
She said she had ""lots of memories"" working at the site and it was a shame to see it gone.
Melissa Major said Newspaper House was the place she really came into her own as a journalist, having worked there from 2017 to 2021.
She said driving past the site and seeing how the demolition progressed made her feel sad.
""I remember as a child being shown round the printing press, then doing work experience and then working there. 
""It was a huge place for so long and now it's gone.""
Cumbrian Newspapers, later known as CN Group, also published the Times & Star, The Whitehaven News, the Evening Mail in Barrow and several magazines.
The company had been owned by the Burgess family, with chairman Robin Burgess overseeing its sale to US-owned media giant Newsquest in 2018.
Viv Paterson worked as a reporter for the company from 2001 until her retirement about a year ago.
She moved to the UK from New Zealand, where she had worked for another family-owned newspaper - the Otago Daily Times.
""Robin told me he'd met the owners of my old paper in New Zealand frequently and he'd even sold a printing press to them,"" she said.
""Newspaper House was the home of this family business for so many years and it's sad this demolition has put a final full stop to that history.""
Work began on the building's demolition in November.
A part-retrospective planning application for the work was approved by Cumberland Council on Monday, according to the Local Democracy Reporting service.
The site was sold at auction in June, but no details have been provided as to what is planned for the site once demolition has been completed.
Printing was moved to Newsquest's print centre in Cambuslang, Glasgow, when the site's press hall closed.
The News & Star and The Cumberland News editorial and commercial teams now operate out of LocaliQ House, near the Newspaper House.

Work to pull down a former fire commander's house in Fronks Road, Dovercourt, Essex, will begin on 27 January.
It will be replaced by a two-storey police station. Plans for the scheme were approved in October 2023.
Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Nolan said staff deserved a station that ""meets the needs of the 21st century"".
The house being demolished is next to a fire station.
It is 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Essex Police's 111-year-old site in Main Road, Harwich, which was one of 15 in Essex that had its front counter closed in 2015.
Essex Police said the new station would serve as an operational policing base for officers. It will not have a front counter.
Ms Nolan said both police and firefighters could work together to ""keep our communities safe"" due to their close proximity.
Roger Hirst, the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner for Essex, added: ""It's taken a lot of hard work from all partners to get to this crucial point, which encapsulates closer future collaboration between both services.""

The event was due to take place in Rugby town centre between 11:00 GMT and 16:00 on Sunday.
Organisers said they were ""bitterly disappointed"" but that their priority was the safety of visitors and staff.
""We appreciate this is disappointing news all round, as so much time and planning has gone into this event and so many people were looking forward to it,"" said Linda Lownes from Rugby First, the town's Business Improvement District.
Organiser Amy Zhang said the event was being held as the number of Chinese families in the areas, attracted by local schools, was growing.
Plans for the day included a procession of dancing lions, dragons, lanterns and drums.
Ms Lownes said the groups involved in staging the event would now focus on organising next year's event instead.
""I am truly devastated that I am having to cancel this event,"" she added.

Operator Red Funnel said its foot passenger and car ferry services had been cancelled due to the weather.
The firm apologised to customers for the inconvenience this had caused to their journeys.
High winds have brought power cuts across the south-west of England as Storm Herminia closed in on the UK on Sunday.
The latest storm was named by the Spanish weather service Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET) on Friday.
On Saturday the Met Office said its predecessor, Storm Éowyn, which affected large parts of the UK this week, was ""probably the strongest storm"" to hit the country in at least 10 years, with wind gusts in excess of 100mph (160km/h).
Yellow weather warnings for rain and wind have been put in place by the Met Office.
These fresh ferry cancellations follow planned disruption to Red Funnel's fast vessel service which began on Sunday.

They include five in Staffordshire, three in Cheshire and one in Shropshire.
The bank said it had seen counter transactions in its buildings reduce by more than half, when comparing figures from October 2019 and October 2024.
In contrast, the bank said more than 80% of its active customers used its digital services and more than 97% of new accounts were now opened online.
Closures announced by NatWest in the West Midlands and Cheshire are:

The bank confirmed it would continue to invest in alternative methods of in-person banking, such as using the Post Office and banking hubs.
However, bosses believe digital banking offers new and inclusive ways for customers - including those who are elderly or vulnerable - to bank that were not previously available.
They accepted that there will be a ""small number"" of people who will feel uncomfortable about the move.

18,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgr6yy44n0o,2025-01-27,Council advised to oppose battery storage scheme,"Councillors have been advised to oppose plans for another battery energy storage scheme in a rural corner of the Borders.
If agreed, the plan near the Eccles substation could meet the electricity needs of more than 30,000 homes.
Three similar developments have already been approved in the area prompting some residents to say the heart is being ""ripped out"" of their village.
Scottish Borders Council's planning officer has recommended councillors object to the most recent project, although the final say will lie with the Scottish government.
The substation in the area is currently being expanded and the storage systems could retain energy generated by wind farms to be released when demand increases.
However, residents have said they are ""worried sick"" by the number and scale of the proposals around the Eccles site.
The latest application is on farmland at Pittlesheugh Farm about a mile (1.5km) north of Eccles.
Applicants The Energy Workshop say it could make a significant contribution towards net zero efforts.
The council's landscape architect has raised concerns about the project, saying it is in conflict with the rural character of the surrounding landscape.
A report to councillors has concluded that it ""does not respect the character"" of the area and the bunds being proposed to screen it would ""introduce an incongruous landscape feature"".
The local planning committee is being advised to object to the project due its unacceptable visual impact and its cumulative effect alongside other developments.
The council's chief planning officer said the adverse impacts would not be outweighed by the contribution towards renewable energy generation and greenhouse gas reduction.
Scottish Borders Council is a consultee on the project but its fate will ultimately be decided by the Scottish government.

Passengers have been urged to plan ahead as trains between London and Peterborough, Royston and Stevenage via Hertford North have all been stopped.
Improvements will be made to the track, drainage and overhead lines from 25 to 26 January and between 1 and 2 February.
Network Rail infrastructure director, Simon Pumphrey, said: ""This work is carefully planned to maximise the time when there are track closures, allowing us to undertake several projects at once and avoiding more frequent track closures.""
There will be no Thameslink or Great Northern services between London and Peterborough, Royston and Stevenage via Hertford North.
Other operators, heading further north, will run reduced services, some with rail replacement bus services.
Mr Pumphrey said: ""We're sorry to passengers affected by the disruption and thank them for their patience as we make improvements that will help make the railway more reliable.""
Preparatory work will also take place as part of the East Coast Digital Programme. 
Customer service director at Govia Thameslink Railway, Jenny Saunders, said: ""We've arranged replacement buses, shuttle trains between Royston and King's Lynn, and ticket acceptance on other routes to help you complete your journeys.""
Engineering work will include renewing the line north of Stevenage and investment in bridge timbers south of Finsbury Park.
At Welwyn Garden City, upgrades will be made to the switch and crossing equipment and tunnel drainage work will be undertaken at Hadley Wood.
Improvements will be made to the overhead line kit at Biggleswade and Bounds Green and under-track cables will be installed between Biggleswade and Peterborough.

They received results from a body called the Schools Entrance Assessment Group (SEAG), which runs the common transfer test.
More than 60 post-primary schools across Northern Ireland use the test to decide which pupils to admit into year eight.
P7 pupils getting their results sat the test papers in November 2024.
Families of pupils who have taken the SEAG tests will use the results they receive to apply to enter a post-primary school.
The majority of Northern Ireland's 190 post-primaries, however, do not use the tests to decide which pupils to admit.
They use other criteria like how close a pupil lives to the school or whether they already have a sibling there.
The SEAG test replaced the separate tests run by the AQE and PPTC organisations until 2023.
Before 2008, there was a state-run 11-plus test used by grammar schools to select pupils.
BBC News NI first revealed details of the new SEAG test in 2021.
Using academic selection has proved controversial over the years though, and the transfer test system has faced criticism.
Some experts have argued that it favours pupils from better-off backgrounds while disadvantaging the less well-off.

Jos Leijdekkers, 33, was sentenced in absentia to 24 years in prison on 25 June last year by a Rotterdam court for smuggling more than seven tonnes of cocaine. 
Dutch prosecutor Wim de Bruin said the fugitive's return to the Netherlands was of ""the highest priority"".
""We are doing everything we can in that regard but we cannot comment any further because of the ongoing investigation,"" he said.
A spokesperson for the Dutch Public Prosecution Service (OM) said Leijdekkers has been living in Sierra Leone for about six months.
They said he is known by the nickname Bolle Jos and that until recently he was suspected to be living in Turkey.
Sierra Leonean authorities have not commented on the claims.
Reuters news agency has reported that Leijdekkers was spotted in Sierra Leone in January when the President of Sierra Leone's wife posted a video on social media of a church service she was attending with her husband.
According to Reuters, Leijdekkers can be seen in the video. The BBC has not been able to verify the footage. 
Dutch police have described Leijdekkers as ""one of the key players in international cocaine trafficking"".
A $210,000 (£168,000) reward is being offered for tip-offs that lead to his arrest. This is reportedly the highest amount ever offered for a Dutch fugitive. 
Leijdekkers is listed as one of the most-wanted fugitives by Europol, the EU's law enforcement agency.
West Africa is a major transit point for the trafficking of cocaine from Latin America.
On 17 January, Sierra Leone recalled its ambassador from neighbouring Guinea after seven suitcases containing suspected cocaine were found in an embassy vehicle.
Guinean authorities impounded a vehicle belonging to Sierra Leone's embassy and detained its occupants on suspicion of possessing ""substances suspected to be cocaine"", Sierra Leone's Foreign Minister Alhaji Musa Timothy Kabba said.
""In light of this serious development, the government has urgently recalled Sierra Leone's ambassador to Guinea, Ambassador Mr Alimamy Bangura, to Freetown to provide a full account of the incident,"" he added.
The recalled envoy was not in the car and is not under arrest, the minister said.
""It has not been proven that the ambassador is involved in this trafficking,"" he added.

One lane was closed, the fire service said, adding there were no injuries reported.
National Highways said traffic delays were expected to last until about 13:30.
LFRS said Network Rail staff had been out to inspect the structure.
The bridge was struck twice in November and also hit by a lorry in October, and was driven into by high vehicles 88 times between 2017 and September 2022.
A study released in July 2023 found the numerous incidents around the bridge had cost thousands of pounds to the local economy.

It was taken from Silver Road while Norfolk Fire Service tackled a blaze at the former Van-Dal shoe factory in Dibden Road, Norwich, on Monday evening.

The service appealed for anybody who saw it get taken, or knows where it has appeared since, to contact them.
A fire service post on Facebook said the helmet was worth about £270: ""We're less interested in the cost at this point and more concerned that somebody decided taking it was acceptable.""
The service added: ""Our firefighters put themselves in danger every day and helmets and other kit ensure their safety.

The French bulldogs were starving and dehydrated when they were found at the address in Derby Road, Southampton, on 25 January 2024, the RSPCA said.
Aprillouise Toni Rushford, 35, from London Road, pleaded guilty to failing to meet the dogs' needs for 17 days as well as causing unnecessary suffering.
 She was given a two-year conditional discharge by Southampton magistrates.
Warning: Distressing image below
The RSPCA said the dogs, which are being rehomed, were reported by the property's landlord.
Jo Story from the charity said: ""I slowly opened the door to see a small French bulldog puppy. 
""She was extremely skinny with all her ribs showing and the room was full of faeces. 
""She was absolutely desperate to get out and chewing at the door. There were scratch marks on the door as well.
""In another room, which was also filled with faeces and clutter including broken plates on the floor, was an underweight adult French bulldog.""
The dogs initially weighed 3.3kg (7.3lb) and 7.3kg (16.1lb), the RSPCA said.
The mother added a third of her weight and the puppy's weight doubled with care, it added.
In her defence, Ms Rushford said she was temporarily staying elsewhere and did not want to tell the landlord about the dogs because she was not allowed pets, according to the charity.

Ava White died in 2021 after she was stabbed by a 15-year-old in Liverpool city centre in a row over a social media video.
Her mother Leeann is backing the prime minister's promise to introduce tougher measures to stop under-18s buying knives online as part of the response to the murder of three young girls in Southport last summer by Axel Rudakubana.
Ms White said she was angry that she continued to wake up to the news of ""kids killing kids"" and said: ""Enough is enough"".
Rudakubana, armed with a knife, went on a ""meticulously planned rampage"" on 29 July last year killing Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, and injuring another 10 victims.
Sir Keir Starmer described the process of buying a knife online as ""shockingly easy"" after it was revealed that Rudakubana bought a knife from Amazon at the age of 17.
Online retailers will now be told to ask buyers for two types of identification before completing a purchase.
Ms White said she had checked the process of buying a knife online since the announcement and claimed it was still possible to buy a Zombie style-knife online without any ID.
""It's so easy for these kids to be getting hold of these knives,"" she said.
""I'm really angry.
""I wake up to [the news of] a 12-year-old child in Birmingham that's been murdered, last week it was a 14-year-old on a bus, and those are just the ones that are in the press, there's so much more.""
""We can't have kids killing kids.""
She said the families of Rudakubana's victims will be in her thoughts on Thursday as he is sentenced, on a day which would have been her daughter's 16th birthday.
""Instead of celebrating and having a party I have to be putting down flowers,"" she said.

The Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme - known as Clare's Law – was launched in 2014 to provide information within 28 days that could protect someone from being a victim of attack.
Thames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Matthew Barber said some responses had taken too long but added the force was making changes to improve.
Earlier this month, the BBC reported Thames Valley Police (TVP) took 85 days to reply to one woman's request, which revealed a man had been jailed for violence against women.
""Undeniably, Thames Valley Police's performance on this hasn't been acceptable and it's been one of those issues that I've been challenging the force on,"" Mr Barber told the Thames Valley Police and Crime Panel in Aylesbury on Friday.
Documents show TVP staff were previously relying on overtime to complete cases but that there had been ""slight improvements"" to the way responses had been completed over the last year.
""The bit that worries me the most is the timeliness [of responses] because clearly there's some criticality to these cases,"" Mr Barber added.
""If there's a risk and it is not disclosed, that's the entire point of the process.""
Launched in 2014, Clare's Law was named after 36-year-old Clare Wood, from Greater Manchester, who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 2009.
Ms Wood was strangled and set on fire at her home in Salford by George Appleton, who had a history of violence against women.
Her father, Michael Brown, campaigned for the law change and said he was convinced she would still have been alive had she known the full extent of Appleton's previous behaviour. Mr Brown died in 2020.
Ms Wood's daughter, Maddy, said last year she worried more lives could be lost because of the ""poor"" way the scheme had been managed nationally.
Jo Robb, a South Oxfordshire district councillor, said TVP risked letting victims down.
""We can talk about police on the beat as much as we like but unless we are responding to women who are asking for information about their partners in a timely way, we are actually completely failing in our duties,"" she said.

Nearly 40 civil enforcement officers in Reading are due to strike between Friday and 6 February.
Unite the Union said it was trying to secure higher pay for the parking wardens, but  Modaxo - the company that Reading Borough Council outsources parking enforcement to - was ""refusing to negotiate"".
A spokesperson for Modaxo said Trellint, the UK business for the Canada-based company, was ""actively working"" to resolve the dispute.
The parking wardens, who also went on strike in December, are currently paid £12 per hour.
Unite said this was ""significantly lower"" than what they would be paid if they were employed directly by the council.
""[Moxado] is a huge multinational conglomerate making billions in revenue and yet sees fit to penny-pinch and pay poverty wages to our members in Reading,"" said Unite general secretary Sharon Graham.
A council spokesperson urged motorists to continue complying with parking regulations during the strike, adding they were ""in place for the safety and wellbeing of all road users"".
""Parking enforcement is still taking place in Reading during the strike periods, albeit at a reduced level,"" they said.

For journalists – they are challenging to cover.
We have the task of putting out information and conveying the seriousness of the situation to the public - and also taking steps to keep ourselves safe.
Red warnings indicate there is a danger to life – and the authorities do not take lightly the decision to issue the alert.
Assessing the risk is part and parcel of our approach to these stories.
Camera operator Niall Gallagher and I went to Westport on the Atlantic coast of Ireland ahead of the red warning coming into force.
We knew in advance that some of the strongest winds in the UK and Ireland would be felt on the western seaboard.
During the hours of the highest level of alert – it was clearly too dangerous to go out into the open.
The sight and sound of debris crashing onto the ground bore testament to the risk that the national weather service, Met Éireann, and emergency services have been speaking about.
So we set up for live broadcasting in a tunnel, connecting our hotel car park to the street.
It meant we can have a good look at the scenes outside, and get an idea of how ferocious the gales were - while remaining sheltered.
This enabled us to film pictures which sufficiently put across the savagery of the storm, without taking a major safety risk.
After the red warning expired, we made the decision to head out again – to survey the damage, talk more to local people, and assess the scale of the clear-up which communities were facing.
Covering the most intense storm to hit the island of Ireland in many years is a team effort – and we are always reliant on our colleagues in BBC Northern Ireland, who have been gathering material from numerous towns, cities and villages.
BBCNI's headquarters at Broadcasting House in Belfast switched to a back-up electricity generator as the busy lunchtime news period approached.
It was a plan to enable the programmes to stay on air, if the wave of power cuts reached the building.
Whether you are in a newsroom or ""on the ground"" – having a plan B (and often a C and D) is often valuable.
It's never more important than when covering bad weather.
If the pattern of recent times continues, we'll be doing it more frequently in the coming years.

The successful dog will appear alongside the character of Musetta in the romantic masterpiece by Puccini.
Ms Kent said: ""I do everything I'm told not to do but it always works - I've had a horse on stage in the Pavilion.

First Minister Eluned Morgan said on Friday that health bosses had to do ""better"""" before they received more funding from the Welsh government.
Responding to her comments, Dr Sacha Moore from the Royal College of Physicians said: ""I don't think the health bosses are the problem here.""
Latest NHS figures show more than 800,000 people in Wales are now waiting for treatment - setting a record for a 10th month in a row.
The numbers waiting in Welsh A&Es for 12 hours or more also hit more than 10,800 - the second highest on record.
Since becoming first minister, Morgan has repeatedly emphasised that she would be holding health bosses on top salaries to account over NHS performance. 
But Dr Moore said that extra funding to help cut waiting lists had ""predominantly focussed on evening and weekend appointments"".
""In order to deliver those appointments you need a robust workforce... and we are at the moment dealing with a workforce that is largely burnt out,"" he said.
He told BBC Politics Wales that to deal with the complex problems in the health service, the money ""needs to be spread more broadly than it is at the moment"".
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions? programme, broadcast from Porthcawl in Bridgend county, Morgan said: ""The system is one where we, as a government, set out the parameters, we then tell the health boards what they're to do.""
She said there needed to be ""better management by the health boards"", adding an ""accountability system"" ensures that ""with the extra money that's gone in, they [health boards] won't get the money unless we get the outcome"".
She said more cash from the UK government meant there was extra investment for the NHS and she wanted to ""assure"" people that waiting times would come down.

Operator Beryl and Dorset Council made 121 e-bikes available across Dorchester, Weymouth and the Isle of Portland last summer.
But Dorset Council said not enough people were renting the bikes, with many choosing to ride their own bikes instead.
The company runs other cycle hire schemes, in which users pick up e-bikes and drop them off at Beryl bays, including in Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole. 
Jon Andrews, cabinet member for place services, said: ""Dorset Council has been informed by Beryl that they intend to close the east Dorset section of their bike hire service at the end of February.
""This is a commercial decision, as the number of people renting bikes isn't enough to maintain the service without additional funding. 
""Evidence suggests that, in this particular area, many people are riding their own bikes and therefore wouldn't choose to rent one, with around 500 people a day using the new cycleways in favourable conditions.
""We are currently exploring options to keep the service in some form, including looking at whether local businesses are interested in subsidising a similar local scheme. 
""We will also continue to work with Beryl on their well-received Dorchester, Weymouth, and Portland bike-hire scheme.""
He said the authority was committed to developing ""active travel options"" in the Ferndown, West Parley, Colehill, and Wimborne area, with sustainable travel remaining a ""top priority"" because of the climate crisis.

Councillor Mike Smith, chair of the council's housing committee, said the grant bid was a practical example of the council doing what it could to help residents cut their costs, while also helping to reduce the impact on the environment.
He said: ""The amount of money we are applying for is substantial, and it really demonstrates the scale of our ambition to help local people reduce how much they have to pay to the big energy companies. 
""The environmental benefits are an equally valuable investment in our futures.""
A decision by DESNZ is expected in the near future.
The authority is already installing similar energy efficiency measures at 169 council homes after receiving a separate £1.25m grant from DESNZ last year.
The works began in December and the council also contributed towards the project.

It comes a day after another court handed a death sentence to a Chinese man who attacked a Japanese mother and child and killed a Chinese woman who tried to protect them in Suzhou city in June.
The courts' decisions come as Chinese authorities carried out several high-profile executions in recent days. 
The stabbings in Shenzhen and Suzhou were among three attacks on foreigners in China last year. Just days before the Suzhou incident, four US college instructors were hurt in a knife attack at a public park in Jilin in the country's north.
After the attack in Shenzhen, Japanese companies, including Toshiba and Toyota, told their staff to take precautions against any possible violence, while Panasonic offered its employees free flights home.
In the Suzhou case, a Chinese court said that Zhou Jiasheng, 52, had carried out the attack outside a Japanese school after he lost the will to live, following the loss of his job and subsequent debts.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters at a press conference that the court ruled that the attack was an ""intentional murder"" and the penalty was given due to the ""significant social impact"" the crime had caused. 
However, the court made no mention of Japan during the ruling, according to Hayashi, who added that officials from the Japanese consulate in Shanghai had attended the sentencing. 
Hayashi added that the crime, which killed and injured ""innocent people"", including a child, was ""absolutely unforgivable"".
He also paid tribute to Hu Youping, the Chinese bus attendant who was killed by Zhou while trying to protect a Japanese mother and her child. 
Earlier on Thursday, Mao Ning, spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, briefly commented in a daily press conference that the case was ""in judicial process"", adding that China would ""as always, act to protect the safety of foreign nationals in China.""
China has been grappling with an uptick in public violence, with many attackers believed to have been spurred by a desire to ""take revenge on society"" - where perpetrators act on personal grievances by attacking strangers. 
There were 19 attacks on pedestrians or strangers last year, a sharp increase from single digits in previous years.
On Monday, a man who killed at least 35 people in a car attack that is thought the be the country's deadliest attack in a decade was executed.
Last month, a man who killed eight people in a stabbing spree at his university was sentenced to death.
Additionally, in December, a man who injured 30 people by driving into a crowd of children and parents outside a primary school was handed a suspended death sentence.

The event at Althorp, in Northamptonshire, was last held in 2018.
In a post on social media Earl Spencer, the brother of Princess Diana, said it would take place between 11 and 13 of April.
He said the festival, which has been held 16 times before, was ""shaping up very well"".
Last year, the Earl published his memoir, A Very Private School, about his time at Maidwell Hall boarding school.
He has also written several books on royal history and the Spencer family.
The Earl said among the authors appearing at the festival were presenter Clare Balding, broadcaster and musician Rev Richard Coles, and comedian and actor David Mitchell.
He said more writers would be confirmed for the event.

Reverend Robyn Golden-Hann was ordained in the Church of England in 2023, and now serves at St. Aldhelm's Church in Poole.
She had previously been a stonemason, before a ""mid-life crisis"" in her 40s ended with her transitioning.
""I worked as a stonemason in very many different capacities, but laying those tools aside and coming into ministry - that in itself has been another transition,"" she said.
""In my wildest dreams, I never ever would have imagined that I would have been ordained and become a priest.
""I think I was struggling with a lot of my own demons, a lot of my own issues, and I really felt that God couldn't possibly love me and there couldn't be a place for me within the church.""
The 58-year-old, originally from Wells in Somerset, had previously been married with children.
But when she reached the age of 40, ""one life came crashing to an end"".
""One winter, I got this terrible, terrible flu and I thought I was dying, and I really felt a sense that actually, I've had enough now,"" she said.
""As I recovered I realized that I simply can't go on beating myself up like this, and that was the beginning of, of the healing of my, my relationship with God.
""Not being angry with God for being trans, but actually accepting, 'okay, well, that's the way you've made me', so I have to do something about that and I have to live with that reality.""
In the hope of improving her relationship with God, Rev Golden-Hann decided to peruse a life in the ministry - and was ordained as a priest in July 2023.
She said her personal experience in the church since her transition had been ""unremittingly positive"".
""In my youth, I really felt as if I was wearing a suit of armour,"" Rev Golden-Hann told the BBC.
""Yet when I was courageous enough to take that suit of armour off, I found that actually people responded with kindness and love when I was willing to put down my own defensive shield.
""Then I was able to hold out my own arms and hug the world and receive the love and the hugs that the world had to offer me.""

Tomasz Kuczynski, 42, was the first eye patient at Hinchingbrooke Hospital in Cambridgeshire to be treated using the Microkeratome. 
The advanced equipment is only available in a few centres in the UK and it enhances the ability to perform different types of complex corneal transplant surgery.
Following his operation, Mr Kuczynski said: ""I can see amazing little details I've not been able to see before, even in simple things like stones and normal objects.""
The machine, purchased through donations, allows patients to access specialist treatment closer to their local area.
It could also significantly reduce patient waiting times and offer more effective treatment and outcomes.
After years of declining vision, Mr Kuczynski was referred to the hospital for surgery after evaluations at Peterborough City Hospital.
""My vision was very poor and was getting even worse. It was like looking through a thick fog, so I was excited about the opportunity to have the surgery,"" he said.
""The two-and-a-half-hour procedure made a remarkable difference. It actually wasn't too uncomfortable.
""Although there were a few days of adjustment, I felt so much better straight after the operation... now I'm recovering, and my eyesight is getting better every day.""
Lead surgeon Jesse Panthagani said while Mr Kuczynski's surgery was complex it went smoothly, and anticipated his full vision would be restored.

The Hop Pole Inn was at risk of redevelopment before being bought by the Limpley Stoke Community Benefit Society in 2022, which was given six weeks to raise £370,000.
The historic Grade II listed Wiltshire pub has since been renovated at a cost of around £1.3m.
""It means everything because without a pub, a village is nothing and has no community,"" said Simon Coombe, chairman of the society. 
Mr Coombe added: ""This is a place where everyone will be coming together, meeting, chatting, getting to know each other, gossiping, and that's what makes a true community.""
As well as inviting local people to invest, the not-for-profit community organisation also received a series of grants to help restore the pub to its former glory.
These included £300,000 from the government's Community Ownership Fund and £10,000 each from the National Lottery and the Swindon-based Hills Group Ltd.

67,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvge3k2pxp0o,2025-01-26,Wynne Evans apologises for 'inappropriate' comment at Strictly tour,"Welsh opera singer Wynne Evans has apologised for making what he described as an ""inappropriate and unacceptable"" comment during the Strictly Come Dancing live tour launch earlier this month.
A Mail on Sunday reporter recorded Evans, 52, making the sexualised remark at the Birmingham Arena as the group prepared for a photo on stage.
""My language was inappropriate and unacceptable, for which I sincerely apologise,"" Evans told BBC News in a statement.
A spokesperson for the Strictly Live Tour and BBC Studios said: ""We have made it very clear to Wynne that we do not tolerate such behaviour on the tour.""
""We were not previously aware of the remark and did not receive any complaints,"" the spokesperson added.
Evans starred in BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing with dance partner Katya Jones last year. He's now taking part in the series tour across the UK, with the last of the 30 performances scheduled for 9 February.
The BBC Radio Wales presenter did not dance during Saturday's show in Glasgow because of an ankle injury, though he did sing. 
The Strictly Live Tour spokesperson said that Evans would be singing at the matinee show on Sunday, and both dancing and singing in evening show.
Evans' behaviour during the show attracted attention from viewers over what some described as awkward incidents. This included Jones appearing to turn down a high-five from Evans and move his hand from her waist during an episode in October.
The duo later said the high-five moment was a ""running joke"" between them, while Jones said it was ""complete nonsense"" that Evans' hand on her waist ""made me feel uncomfortable or offended me in any way"".
Professional dancers Giovanni Pernice and Graziano Di Prima left the show last year following allegations about their behaviour towards their dance partners. 
The BBC apologised to actress Amanda Abbington about Pernice's behaviour during the 2023 series of the show and upheld her complaints accusing him of verbal bullying and harassment.
The BBC announced new welfare measures for Strictly last July, including introducing chaperones in all rehearsal rooms, adding two new welfare producers and providing additional training for the professional dancers, production team and crew.
Last year's series was won by comedian Chris McCausland, Strictly's first blind contestant, who was paired with professional dancer Dianne Buswell.
Evans is most widely known for starring in adverts for Go.Compare from 2009. The tenor is also a presenter for BBC Radio Wales and is featuring in the BBC series Wynne & Joanna: All at Sea with actress Joanna Page, which is being released on Monday.
A spokesperson for BBC Wales said it supported BBC Studios' statement, adding: ""We do not tolerate unacceptable behaviour.""

The post will ""provide a unique and transformational addition to mental health at Cambridge and beyond"" by advancing science and offering evidence-based support to young people, the university said.
It was made possible by £4.5m from US-based philanthropists Christina and Peter Dawson, who champion mental health and have supported the university for many years. 
""Our ambition is to promote student wellbeing as a fundamental component of a Cambridge education and to lead research on effective interventions that will improve their lives,"" said Vice-Chancellor Prof Deborah Prentice. 
""The Dawson Professorship of Young People's Mental Health represents a great leap forward towards this goal.""
It comes a little over two years after the university said it was undertaking ""significant reform"" to its mental health services after a spate of student deaths.
At the time, the BBC uncovered a report which described the mental health service as ""ineffective"".
The postholder - who will hold a fellowship at St Catharine's College - will spearhead research on interventions, neuroscience, and evidence synthesis to provide new insight and pioneering discoveries in mental health treatment and prevention, the university said.
""We are thrilled that the university is dedicated to being a centre of excellence in mental health research for young people, and that this Professorship will be transformational to this vital area of research,"" said Mrs Dawson.
""Cambridge's revolutionary approach will reveal insights into the brain science of mental health in young people and increase the global understanding and development of new interventions.""
Prof of Neuroscience Jeffrey W. Dalley said the gift would be ""truly transformative"" in accelerating research efforts to understand the brain science of mental health in young people.
""To have a professorship dedicated to mental health research in young people, right here in Cambridge, is simply wonderful, said Natalie Acton, co-head of student support.
""We look forward to working with the post-holder and improving our offering to students as a result.""
Recruitment is under way with the successful candidate expected to begin in October.

69,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gprn6evzzo,2025-01-24,Net zero carbon roadmap to 2030 agreed by council,"A city council has agreed a roadmap to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2030.
Peterborough City Council signed off on the report, which lays out ways it could further reduce its own emissions, but stops short of allocating funding.
It was welcomed by most councillors, but described as ""woke nonsense"" by the leader of the council's Conservative group.
The council unanimously declared a climate emergency in 2019, when it also committed to its 2030 target.
The report, presented by the council's Labour administration, said ""significant progress"" has already been made towards decarbonisation, with a 28.6% decrease in CO2e emissions between 2018-19 and the most recent reporting year of 2022-23.
The city council said that, in future, it could improve building insulation, introduce motion activated lighting in car parks and switch from diesel to renewable hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) for its vehicles. 
But even if all of the quantified steps laid out in the roadmap were implemented in full, it would still only amount to a 78% reduction in the council's emissions compared to 2018/19.
""Additional unquantified measures, along with advances in technology, are expected to help reduce these emissions further,"" the report said.
Former council leader Wayne Fitzgerald said at a meeting that he was ""sick and tired of this net zero nonsense"", which he described as ""woke"".
He said the 2030 target was ""unachievable"" and that he would repeal the council's declaration of a climate emergency if he was ever elected council leader again.
Peterborough First councillor Gavin Elsey said there were a ""number of people across the country who have an alternative opinion on carbon and the effect on global warming"" and that a resident who had written to councillors about this did not appear to have been given a ""fair voice"".
Council leader Dennis Jones compared Mr Fitzgerald's comments to those of US president Donald Trump. 
Liberal Democrat group leader Christian Hogg said he was concerned the council was being asked to do ""70% of the work in half of the time"".
He also raised the issue of cost, saying HVO was more expensive than diesel and reduced a vehicle's mileage per gallon.
Another Lib Dem councillor, Chris Wiggins, raised concerns about the inclusion of the council's Peterborough Integrated Renewables Infrastructure (PIRI) scheme in the roadmap, as it involved heat and electricity generation from an energy-to-waste incinerator.
A BBC investigation found that incinerators were the dirtiest way the UK generated power.
He said he also wanted to see detail on how the council would reach net zero rather than reducing its emissions by the projected 78%.

The 306th Bombardment Group Museum, a former ammunition storage building, in Thurleigh, Bedfordshire, was opened in 2002.
Sam Stants, a volunteer, said it houses artefacts and belongings of the group ""to keep the memories of those that served"" from 1942 to 1945. 
He said the building needed new front doors, new fascias and guttering repairs - and the heating system required an overhaul.
Mr Stants said the building was constructed in the ""early 1940s, in the middle of World War Two"". 
""It's on an old airfield, which is open to the elements, and over the past few years with all the wet weather we've had, we've stated to notice things that need upgrading and repairing,"" he said.
He aded that it was hoping to raise £2,500, and had already reached £1,100, which was ""phenomenal"". 
It is based at Bedford Autodrome, the former home of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) Bedford.
Mr Stants said families of the veterans regularly came over to visit from the United States.
""We want to give them a place that they know, that they can retrace their families footsteps and were we are there to support that,"" he said.
He added that the repairs would ""keep it going and keep the memories of those that served there"". 
The 306th Bombardment group arrived from the Wendover Airfield in Utah, USA, in September 1942 and went on to lead the first USAAF daylight bomb raid over Germany on 27 January.
It completed 341 combat missions, the second highest flown in the Eighth Air Force and the first bomb group in the Eighth Army to complete 300 missions. 
At its height, the airbase was home to about 3,000 personnel.
Mr Stants said their presence would have created a ""large long-lasting impact on Thurleigh and this area of [north] Bedfordshire, it's really important that we can spread the message of what happened there"". 
On 26 April, 1944, nine members of the 306th Bombardment Group were killed shortly after they took off from the airfield. 
After experiencing an engine fire, the plane came down in nearby Bletsoe. 
Only the tail gunner, George Littlefield, survived.

Sir David, 69, died after being stabbed 21 times by Ali Harbi Ali at a constituency surgery in Leigh-on-Sea on 15 October 2021.
At his sentencing, the Old Bailey was told Ali had been known to authorities and was referred to the government's Prevent programme, but continued plotting in secret.
""Nothing has been learned, it's all verbiage and no-one has been held accountable, not one person,"" said Katie Amess.
The Prevent programme is a key part of the UK's counter-terrorism strategy, and places public bodies, including schools and the police, under a legal duty to identify people who may turn to extremism, and intervene in their lives before it is too late.
Liverpool Crown Court heard last week that warnings were sounded over Southport murderer Axel Rudakubana, including three referrals to Prevent, before he killed Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine at a dance class in July.
Rudakubana was jailed for 52 years after pleading guilty to three counts of murder. 
""My heart is absolutely broken for the poor, poor families of the [Southport] victims and and all the little girls that have injuries that are going to be life changing for them,"" Ms Amess said.
""The similarities [between the cases] are uncanny and I just wish to God no-one had to know the pain that my family went through.""
Ms Amess wants the government to release more information on who knew what and when about Ali Harbi Ali, who is serving a whole-life sentence for murder and preparing acts of terrorism.
She has a separate complaint about the protection offered to Sir David by Essex Police, which has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme, Ms Amess said she would not accept that Prevent's failure to keep track of referrals was the result of a swamped scheme or ""admin issues"".
""He [Ali] was never followed up again, he was released back into the system,"" she said. 
""I don't think that's because they're overwhelmed, I think it's because they're incompetent.
She told the BBC: ""It's happening time and time again, we've got the London bridge attacks, the Streatham attacks, the friends who were attacked in a [Reading] park, the detonation of a device on the Tube, these are not one-off attacks. 
""So far, the institutions have just managed to skirt around their failings. 
""Keir Starmer said himself that he is not going to allow for institutions to deflect their responsibilities for their failures in these horrific murders.
""That's exactly what I have been saying has been happening, so we will hold him accountable and make sure he follows through on that promise.""
She said she hoped the Southport families would one day be able to separate the girls' lives from their deaths - as she tried to do with her father. 
""I won't let my dad's life and legacy be defined by that one act of evil. 
""Getting answers and getting accountability for all of the people the Prevent system has failed will go a long way in helping them [Southport families] heal and help them disassociate those darling girls lives' with what happened to them at the end.""

A yellow weather warning from the Met Office for wind speeds of up to 50mph (80km/h) was in place for between 05:00 and 15:00 GMT.
Train services between London and Norwich were disrupted by a fallen tree.
Some flights out of Stansted Airport in Essex and Norwich Airport were cancelled and a 40mph (64km/h) speed restriction was in place for the Orwell Bridge near Ipswich.
Flights departing Stansted to Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, Knock and Belfast were all chalked off, and other routes were delayed.
One of Ryanair's Boeing 737s departed Stansted at 08:35, but was unable to land at the Scottish capital, so it touched down at the Essex airport two hours and 44 minutes later.
Passengers onboard the 09:33 Ryanair flight from Luton had a similar experience. The plane failed to touch down at Dublin, so it landed back at Bedfordshire roughly three hours later.
A 15:45 Loganair flight from Norwich to Aberdeen was also cancelled.
Greater Anglia services have been suspended at Shenfield, Essex, and the trainline has warned passengers not to travel.
A tree had fallen on overhead electrical wires and a Network Rail response team was sent to deal with it.
The spokesperson said: ""Debris has also been blown onto the track from a wall that has blown over in a separate, but nearby incident. Network Rail response teams are en route.
""Unfortunately, we are unable to guarantee that passengers will be able to complete their journeys. Customers are advised not to travel on the affected routes.""
The routes that have been affected include London Liverpool Street to Southend Victoria, as well as Braintree, Colchester, Clacton-on-Sea, Ipswich and Norwich.
Friday's weather warning for wind covered the entirety of the East of England and London, as well as much of the South East, and parts of the South West and West Midlands.
The Met Office said delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport were likely, and short term loss of power was possible.
A separate yellow weather warning for heavy rain was in place from 08:00 on Sunday until 06:00 on Monday, which was due to affect most of the eastern region - parts of Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire and Essex.
The Met Office said it expected up to 20mm (0.7in) of rain to fall, but there could be up to 50mm (1.9in) over high ground.
People were warned the extra rainfall on top of recent downpours could lead to some surface water and river flooding.
Earlier, the Met Office issued a rare red warning for Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland.

Speaking to a crowd in Cambridge on Saturday, the president of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), Tom Bradshaw thanked farmers and the public for engaging with the national day of action, as protests took place across the East.
A petition signed by more than 270,000 people was handed into Downing Street by Mr Bradshaw and NFU Cymru president Aled Jones, urging the government to ditch the ""devastating family farm tax"".
A government spokesperson said: ""Our commitment to farmers remains steadfast.""
Speaking after the event on Parker's Piece in Cambridge, Mr Bradshaw said: ""We've got to keep the pressure on government to make them recognise that the policies contained within the Budget, the proposals around inheritance tax and agricultural property release are absolutely wrong.
""They must change them to remove those elderly farmers from the eye of the storm.""
A government spokesperson said: ""This government will invest £5bn into farming over the next two years, the largest budget for sustainable food production in our country's history.

74,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m5ee8pjgdo,2025-01-23,Gull management discussions after child attacks,"Conservation body NatureScot has said it is happy to discuss what gull management measures can be taken in the Borders after reports of children being attacked.
Councillors were told last year that youngsters had been left with blood running down their faces in Eyemouth where the birds were ""out of control"".
It prompted calls for a pilot project in the town to look at ways to drive down numbers.
NatureScot said it was working with a number of areas to look at what could be done to address their issues ahead of breeding season this year.
It said it was ready to work with any local authority that needed assistance with ""plans or strategic approaches"" to deal with gulls.
Scottish Borders Council (SBC) heard last year that seven children were attacked by herring gulls in the space of a month and left with gashes to their scalps.
Councillor James Anderson said last year that he hoped action could be taken before the end of March to tackle the situation.
""We will never have a gull-free Eyemouth - we will have a limited number of gulls in Eyemouth, smaller numbers,"" he said.
NatureScot said it would be willing to work with the local authority to look at what measures could help tackle the situation.
However, it stressed it needed to balance protecting bird numbers with any public health or safety risks.
""While we have not yet engaged directly with SBC, we have had discussions with local representatives and would be very happy to work with any local authority that needs assistance with plans or strategic approaches,"" it said in a statement.
Last year, NatureScot updated its guidance for gull licensing in response to ""significant and serious"" declines in populations.
That has been attributed to factors such as changes in food availability and land use, with some species also suffering losses because of recent outbreaks of avian flu.
That led to the NatureScot stressing that licensed control measures could only be used as a ""last resort"" when there was a risk to public health and safety.
However, it said it realised there were differing views on the birds.
""We know that gulls can sometimes cause issues in our towns and cities and that recent changes to licensing guidance to help conserve gull populations have caused concern for some people,"" it said a statement.
""However, the evidence is clear that gulls are struggling, and we have a duty to balance the conservation and protection of the species with public interests such as safeguarding people from health and safety risks.
""Ahead of the 2025 gull breeding season, we are working with several local authorities to look at how we can support a more coordinated approach to gull management across a number of town and city centres.""
It said it had been ""working closely"" with Inverness, Elgin, Nairn and Aberdeen, providing advice and guidance on their gull management plans.
NatureScot said its focus would be advising on preventative measures, deterrents and guidance for local authority staff, business owners and the public.
""We also provide advice on management plans to ensure they will be effective in tackling gull issues,"" it said.

Unit 33 in Friars Square Shopping Centre, Aylesbury, is part of Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust's Health on the High Street initiative. 
It offers services and advice, including blood pressure monitoring, speech and language therapy, dementia advice, breastfeeding support and veterans' support.
Gemma Thomas, director of strategic delivery at the trust, said: ""In the first year 20,000 people accessed the unit... we are supporting people with babies and young children with their families, right through to elderly people.""
First-time parents Jade and Matt have been able to use the service for themselves and their daughter. 
""We don't have to battle to see a GP,"" said Jade, who works for a charity. 
""It made a big, big difference. As a first-time mum you have concerns... you know you can just come in on a Tuesday and you have that advice here on hand.""
Matt, a police officer, thinks the hub could have the potential to change men's health perceptions. 
""For us as new parents, it's a godsend,"" he said.
""They have a lot of support, including mental health, and for things more specific to men as well. 
""You can come here, not be judged and you can just get some advice rather than feeling you have to book an appointment, which is the first hurdle - you can just pop in."" 
So far 605 people have visited to have their blood pressure checked, with 161 alerted that theirs was high. 
Ms Thomas said the unit was set up to support people in taking control of their health and wellbeing. 
She said life expectancy in Aylesbury was much lower than in other parts of Buckinghamshire, by up to 12 years for women and eight years for men.
Ms Thomas said health issues seen in the town included higher rates of smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption.
""We are trying to support people who might not access our services in the normal way,"" she said.

76,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9qyd7wd1wo,2025-01-27,Pharmacists in warning over weight-loss jab sales,"Pharmacy leaders have issued a fresh warning over the online sale of weight-loss jabs insisting there is still a risk to patient safety.
The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) has called for tougher rules in a letter to regulators, adding it was aware of people who previously had eating disorders or whose body weight was already low, being wrongly prescribed the drugs.
They argue a two-way consultation with the patient lasting at least 20 minutes is needed rather than relying on online questionnaires to access drugs such as Wegovy or Mounjaro.
""It is also important to ensure that clinical decisions regarding weight loss injections are not influenced by financial targets or incentives,"" NPA chairman Nick Kaye said.
The NPA has written to the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) saying current rules leave the door open for medicines to be supplied without appropriate checks ""and the risk to patient safety remains"".
The call comes amid warnings of a boom in demand for weight-loss jabs this year as ministers look to expand the rollout of the medication on the NHS.
Mr Kaye told the PA news agency: ""Obesity is one of the biggest challenges facing our country and pharmacies want to play their part in helping patients lose and maintain a healthy weight.
""Weight-loss injections can play an important role in efforts to tackle obesity when prescribed as part of a carefully managed treatment programme for patients who are most in need of support.
""However, we are concerned that the current regulations allow some patients to inappropriately access weight-loss injections without proper consultation or examination of historical medical records.""
Hundreds of thousands of people are estimated to get their prescriptions privately through online pharmacies.
Weight-loss jabs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, work by reducing food cravings.
The NPA has previously urged patients to avoid buying weight loss injections from unregulated online sellers, who may be selling fake drugs.
A person's medical history should also be examined before sellers decide whether or not to dispense a weight-loss injection, and regular reviews must take place, it added.
Ashley Cohen of the National Pharmacy Association said that while the weight loss jabs are meant for people with a BMI of 30 or more, increasing numbers of the ""worried well"" are seeking them out as a ""lifestyle"" medication.
Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Cohen warned that the injections can have serious side-effects, including stomach upsets, nausea and gallstones.
A spokesperson from the GPhC said it requires all pharmacies, including those online, to ensure the way services are delivered safeguards the health, safety and wellbeing of patients and the public.
They added: ""We have published guidance specifically for the safe and effective provision of pharmacy services at a distance which we expect online pharmacies in Great Britain to follow.
""We will be issuing an updated version shortly, which will set out additional safeguards around high-risk medicines, including medicines used for weight management.""

Harry Richardson, who is chair of the trustees of Suffolk Accident Rescue Services (SARS), credits the charity's responders with saving his life in a road traffic collision in 2013.
The service, established in 1972 and based in Woolpit near Bury St Edmunds, has now recorded its 20,000th emergency callout.
""As a direct result of that care I am in position where I am still living, breathing and otherwise enjoying life. If SARS didn't exist, then I wouldn't either,"" Mr Richardson said.
SARS is run by volunteers, with the team made up of anaesthetists, critical care paramedics and other clinicians with enhanced pre-hospital skills.
It attends about 30% of the incidents it is called out to across the whole of Suffolk.
Volunteers attended 520 callouts in 2023, and 630 callouts last year.
Recalling the collision on BBC Radio Suffolk, Mr Richardson said: ""I suffered from quite extensive injuries, numerous fractures, a ruptured spleen... and both of my lungs were punctured and partially collapsed.
""SARS responded within minutes. A SARS highly skilled responder was first on the scene, which is not abnormal.""
Mr Richardson joined the charity as a trustee nine years ago, which he said was his way of ""giving back"".
""I'm not a clinician in my professional life, but I immediately recognised the enormous value that the charity does,"" he added.
""I wanted to particularly provide my perspective as a patient because I think ultimately what we're all here for is to provide the best possible care that we can for people when they need it.""

Wilshees Waste and Recycling, based in Burton-upon-Trent, was brought in to help shift the 15m-long pile of flytipped rubbish which had blocked Watery Lane in Lichfield.
Officers at Lichfield District council said they were investigating the incident, and that evidence uncovered so far was ""pointing in one direction"".
They continued to appeal to members of the public to come forward with CCTV or doorbell video footage.
""Willshee's has been working with the local council for 30 years and we are proud to support the community,"" said the firm's managing director Dean Wilshee.
""Fly-tipping is not only an eyesore, it is a health hazard that causes considerable disruption to businesses and local residents.
""We're pleased to have been able to quickly remove the waste and ensure that the community was up and running again very quickly.""
He said his firm was on-site from just after 07:00 GMT on Tuesday and had removed the waste within hours.
Mr Wilshee added that the firm had a ""zero waste to landfill"" policy, and that they had ensured all the flytipped rubbish was taken to its recycling facility to be separated into recyclable materials - including metals, wood, cardboard and plastics.
Phil Whitehouse, the council's cabinet member responsible of waste, said those responsible for dumping the waste needed to be held to account and said it appeared to have been a calculated operation.

New trains with more than two carriages, are expected to be added to line between Shrewsbury and Birmingham in the spring, Transport for Wales (TfW) said. 
The increase was confirmed after the MP for Shrewsbury, Labour's Julia Buckley, told TfW bosses the service was unable to support the area's demand.
""It should be three carriages and we're only getting two. There's more people who need to get from Shrewsbury to Birmingham, or Wolverhampton every day and that is the service that is letting us down"", she said. 
""Top-end businesses are telling me they want to expand, invest and employ more people, but this is impossible until we get better services"". 
The trains will be introduced on the Cambrian line, which runs between the Midlands and the Welsh coast, as part of an £800m investment to transform rail services. 
A spokesperson for TfW said: ""Every effort is being made to get them into service to alleviate some of the crowding problems customers are seeing.""
Buckley also called for services to be made more reliable. 
""The amount of cancelled trains there are is not okay. The potential and demand is there, we just need the services"", she said. 
TfW said it had been ""a challenging time on the line"" and thanked customers for their patience.

Nottinghamshire County Council wants to build a 250m (820ft) embankment, known as a bund, across parkland near Southwell Minster.
The authority said the measure would protect 36 properties from flooding and reduce the risk to more by holding back water from Potwell Dyke and allowing it to be released slowly.
Southwell suffers regular flooding, most notably in 2013 when 300 properties were submerged, the council added.
Planning application documents said the bund was proposed across Potwell Dyke, on parkland south of Church Street.
If approved, the bund - to be made of 5,200 tonnes of imported clay - will be about 2.5m (8.2ft) at it's highest level, the council said.
The documents say it would take about 16 weeks to construct.
A council report said the bund, along with previously completed flood alleviation projects, would reduce flood risk to 248 homes and 66 businesses in the town.
The scheme has been recommended for approval ahead of a planning committee meeting on Tuesday.

When launching her campaign, Ms Dupre it was a ""key election"" and added she wanted Cambridgeshire and Peterborough ""to be greener, fairer, and better connected"".
""There is a desperate need for genuinely affordable homes in the right places, and a Liberal Democrat mayor using new powers handed down from government, can make that happen,"" she said.

The DUP's Diane Dodds said it was vital that the 17,500 women, including those who developed cancer and the families of those who died, know their experiences count.
She was speaking as health officials provided an update on the cervical review to the Northern Ireland Assembly's health committee.
The chair of Stormont's Health Committee said the cervical screening review, especially around the underperformance of screeners, proves that Northern Ireland should introduce a duty of candour.
Sinn Féin's Liz Kimmins said there was a responsibility on all staff, who were working at the time, to have raised concerns over the underperformance of four screeners.
She said that she remains ""shocked"" that their underperformance went unchecked for 14 years and asked the Public Health Agency why alarm bells did not ring a lot sooner.
The health committee heard there are currently three external reports ongoing into what happened at the Southern Health Trust.
The trust's medical director, Dr Steve Austin, said looking back things appear obvious and should have been picked up but that they were not obvious at the time.
The Public Health Agency said the data it received from the trust was wide-ranging but did not reflect individual workers.
Eleven women in the Southern Health Trust, whose cervical smear slides were found to have pre-cancerous changes, are continuing with treatment.
However BBC News NI understands that none have gone on to develop cancer.
The trust's acting chief executive again apologised to all the women affected.
Colm McCafferty said the review was essential for building trust and confidence in the cervical screening programme.
He again acknowledged the failings that had been identified.

Dame Karen Bradley, who represents the Staffordshire Moorlands, said she was concerned the government wanted to force the area to become part of a ""Greater Stoke-on-Trent"" against the will of residents.
The government said simplifying local government and transferring more powers away from London would help drive economic growth.
Proposals for Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent have not yet been shared publicly.
At present, Staffordshire Moorlands District Council is responsible for things like bin collections, planning permission, leisure centres and licensing.
Dame Karen said she was wanted to preserve the current two-council structure, saying the district and county authorities ""work well together"".
Staffordshire County Council is responsible for things like roads, libraries and schools – as well as adult's and children's social care.
The government said it wanted to merge areas where there are currently two types of local authority, meaning one council would cover a larger area and take care of all of the services currently shared out between the separate authorities.
Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the government would work with local leaders to deliver its plans - but where they were unable to agree a way forward, ministers would get the power to push the plans through.
Dame Karen believes that strategy is not acceptable and wants people to be given more ability to reject the proposals.
Her intervention comes after the leader of Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council, Simon Tagg, recently said he was against the idea merging local authorities in Staffordshire.
She also thinks retaining local decision-making is the best option for people in her rural constituency.
""Nothing against the people in Stoke-on-Trent – great people – but they are not living in the Moorlands, they don't know what our problems are, they don't know what our issues are,"" she said.
""I want to make sure it's local people making those decisions.""
She added: ""I just think that people really care about the Moorlands, they do not want to lose the Moorlands – we do not want to be 'Greater Stoke-on-Trent', that is really important to us.""

The former Van-Dal factory in Dibden Road, Norwich, was wrecked by fire on Monday, with 17 crews called to tackle the flames.
Hemingford Group had submitted plans to demolish the building and construct 48 homes, with the company having to shift its focus to containing asbestos and ensuring damaged structures would not collapse.  
""We are still pursuing the redevelopment of the site but we are primarily concerned with securing its safety,"" said Rob Harrison, of Warwickshire-based Hemingford.
Earlier this week, the city council had urged residents to shut their windows and avoid touching debris due to the risk of asbestos, and a nearby school closed over safety fears. 
A partial demolition has been completed, with Norfolk Police conducting an arson investigation. 
Mr Harrison said all asbestos had been contained and would be removed at a later date, with other demolition work continuing on Thursday.
Referring to the company's hopes for the site, he said it had been in productive talks with Norwich City Council, but the planning application from 2023 had stalled due to Natural England's advice to council's about new housing developments.
""It has been infuriating as a small company to shell out huge costs for a project like this while politicians dilly-dally – and then someone burns the building down,"" he said.
""Previously, the demolition work would have been straightforward.

Many new 20mph zones have been introduced in the region over recent years but existing roadside fixed cameras are not approved by the Home Office to enforce speeds below 30mph (48.3km/h).
Thames Valley Police said it issued 109 Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) to drivers caught exceeding 20mph limits after they were clocked on handheld speed devices in 2024.
The region's police and crime commissioner (PCC) Matthew Barber said he would expect FPNs to be issued if officers spot offending but that faster roads are statistically more dangerous.
Oxfordshire County Council approved an £8m plan to cut speed limits to 20mph on up to 85% of its 30mph roads in 2021, and others have been introduced in Berkshire.
""There has always been and there always will be enforcement for 20mph. When [councils] introduce them that does not suddenly mean we have loads of capacity for enforcement of 20mph,"" Mr Barber said. 
""If you have roads policing or a neighbourhood officer who's got a calibrated speed gun and the limit is 20[mph] and someone is doing 30 then that can absolutely be enforced and I would expect it to be.""
He told the Thames Valley's Police and Crime Panel on Friday: ""That doesn't mean that police are suddenly going to pop up with speed guns and start enforcing it. That is not non-enforcement, that is the same level of enforcement [seen on other roads] because we don't have any resource to do the enforcement.""
Mr Barber said the most dangerous roads tend to be the fastest ones.
He said in a 20-year period across the Thames Valley, 1,600 people died on roads where the speed limit was 40mph or more and 600 people died on roads which had a 30mph limit or lower.
""That is not to say we do nothing about the smaller stuff – of course local roads matter. 
""But where can we save people's lives? It's where they're dying and that's generally not in these local communities where they're travelling at 20 and 30 [mph], thankfully,"" Mr Barber added.

The force added 20,300 people had signed up to the scheme, set up in September 2024, and they had already helped solve major crimes in Coventry. 
West Midlands Police are one of only two police forces in the UK who have started using such a system. 
Those who sign up to the database receive a text or email when a crime has happened close to their home or business.

Despite the ""girl"", who was an undercover police officer, stating how old she was, Fowler's messages were sexual in nature, said Cambridgeshire Police.
He was first arrested in early 2024 and his phone was seized and analysed. The indecent images of children it contained included five in category A – the most severe.
There were also four extreme pornographic images of adults with animals.
He was arrested again in October 2024 while on bail - after being caught by another undercover police officer.

Dylan Hurd Maskery, 18, from Stoke-on-Trent and Callum Talbot, 23, from South Staffordshire, appeared at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court earlier this week.
Police said their victim was not seriously injured in the robbery, which happened in Womborne on 11 September.
Both men have been remanded in custody and are due to be sentenced on 21 March.
Staffordshire Police said Hurd Maskery and Talbot launched an attack on a man in Brooke Road after demanding the keys to his Volkswagen Golf R. 
They took the keys from the victim's pocket and officers later found the vehicle abandoned on a car park off Terrace Street, Brierley Hill, near Dudley.
""I can assure local communities that burglary, theft and robbery remains a key focus area for proactive officers who are working around the clock to stop to those responsible and put them before the courts,"" said Det Sgt Marc Proctor.

The image was taken in the library of the Royal Family's Scottish holiday home in Aberdeenshire in the autumn.
The King's kilt was made from the King Charles III tartan, based on the Balmoral tartan sett - or pattern - which dates back to about 1850.
The photo was issued as the King prepares to visit the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp for the 80th anniversary of its liberation on 27 January.
The green, blue and red pattern was designed by the Scottish Tartans Authority in 2023 to recognise ""His Majesty's strong support in preserving the culture and traditions of Highland Dress and Scottish Tartans"".
The King is also seen wearing a tie in matching colours and a brown sporran - a pouch that hangs in front of a kilt.
The new photo was taken by Millie Pilkington, who has photographed the Royal Family on multiple occasions, including as the private photographer for the wedding of the Prince and Princess of Wales in 2011. 
She also took the picture of the King and Queen Camilla in the garden of Buckingham Palace that featured on their Christmas card last year.
The photo of the King at Balmoral was released to mark Burns Night. The annual celebration commemorates the life of Robert Burns, Scotland's national poet, who died in 1796. 
The night is traditionally marked with a supper of haggis, accompanied by neeps and tatties - mashed turnips and potatoes.
On Tuesday, the King will travel to Auschwitz, in Poland, to take part in a Holocaust commemoration ceremony.
It is his first trip of the year, and comes almost 12 months after he was diagnosed with cancer. 
He withdrew from public events for a number of weeks while starting treatment but resumed attending events in April, visiting Australia and Samoa late last year.

Bodega Cantina, which was located in St Martins Square and specialised in South American cuisine, said it would be shutting its doors for the final time at the end of Sunday.

100,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9qjjj4zy5o,2025-01-26,CIA says lab leak most likely source of Covid outbreak,"The CIA on Saturday offered a new assessment on the origin of the Covid outbreak, saying the coronavirus is ""more likely"" to have leaked from a Chinese lab than to have come from animals. 
But the intelligence agency cautioned it had ""low confidence"" in this determination. 
A spokesperson said that a ""research-related origin"" of the pandemic ""is more likely than a natural origin based on the available body of reporting"".
The decision to release that assessment marks one of the first made by the CIA's new director John Ratcliffe, appointed by Donald Trump, who took over the agency on Thursday. 
Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during President Trump's first term, has long favoured the lab leak theory, claiming Covid most likely came from a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
The institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged.
In an interview with Breitbart News published on Friday, Ratcliffe said he wanted the CIA to abandon its neutral stance on the origins of the virus and ""get off the sidelines"". 
""One of the things that I've talked about a lot is addressing the threat from China on a number of fronts, and that goes back to why a million Americans died and why the Central Intelligence Agency has been sitting on the sidelines for five years in not making an assessment about the origins of Covid,"" he said. 
""That's a day-one thing for me.""
But officials told US media that the new assessment was not based on new intelligence and predates the Trump administration. The review was reportedly ordered in the closing weeks of the Biden administration and completed before Trump took office on Monday. 
The review offered on Saturday is based on ""low confidence"" which means the intelligence supporting it is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory. 
There is no consensus on the cause of the Covid pandemic. 
Some support a ""natural origin"" theory, which  argues the virus spread naturally from animals, without the involvement of any scientists or laboratories.
The lab leak hypothesis specifically has been hotly contested by scientists, including many who say there is no definitive evidence to back it up. And China has in the past dismissed the lab claim as ""political manipulation"" by Washington. 
Still, the once controversial theory has been gaining ground among some intelligence agencies. 
In 2023, FBI Director Christopher Wray told Fox News it was his bureau's assessment that ""the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident"".

It is the second time in 12 months that the statue in Sydney has been vandalised.
Australia Day is a national holiday that is held each year on 26 January - the anniversary of Britain's First Fleet landing at Sydney Cove in 1788. Many Indigenous Australians say the date causes them pain.  
The local council in Randwick - the suburb where the statue is located - described the vandalism as ""a disservice to the community and a disservice to reconciliation"".
Councillor Carolyn Martin told Sydney radio station 2GB that the vandals had knocked off one hand and parts of the face and nose. 
The statue - which was first unveiled in 1874 - was previously targeted in February last year, when it was covered with red paint and had parts of its sandstone damaged. Works to repair and restore it were completed a month later. 
There are several Captain Cook statues across Australia, and others have also been vandalised on or around 26 January. 
In 2024, one in Melbourne was cut down on the eve of the holiday, while its plinth was spray-painted with the words ""the colony will fall"". Two years earlier the same statue had been splashed with red paint, while in 2018 it was graffitied with the words ""no pride"" and had an Aboriginal flag placed next to it.
Cook charted Australia's east coast in 1770, laying the groundwork for the later decision to send the First Fleet, which was led by Captain Arthur Phillip.
Australia Day is a contentious holiday for some, particularly among those in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who view it as a reminder of the dispossession and displacement of their people.
To many Australians though, it is celebrated as a day of nation-building and achievement. Polling suggests a majority of people are supportive of keeping the holiday, despite suggestions it should be changed to a different date.

She is also nominated for artist of the year, best pop and dance act and song of the year with Guess, featuring Billie Eilish, which went to number one in August.
Her sixth studio album was released in June and grew into a cultural movement - Brat was crowned Collins Dictionary 2024 word of the year and it even reached US politics with presidential candidate Kamala Harris giving her social media a brat rebrand.
Seven-time Brit winner Dua Lipa has received four nominations including pop act which she won last year.

They are also nominated for group of the year and best alterative/rock act which is voted for by the public. 
The Beatles are another oldie but goldie band nominated. They are nominated for song of the year with Now And Then, making it their first nomination since 1977. 
Billed as their ""final song"", Now and Then was started by John Lennon in 1978, but only completed in 2022 by Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Ringo Star.
Released in November 2023, the song meets the eligibility criteria as it has spent at least eight weeks in the top 15 ranked British songs based on sales. 
Ezra Collective, make their Brits debut with four nominations. The group become the first jazz act to win the Mercury Prize in 2023 with their album Where I'm Meant To Be.
Similarly, The Last Dinner Party - last year's rising star winners - have four nominations.

Myles Smith is also nominated in the category and his feel-good foot-stomper Stargazing, which became the biggest-selling British single of 2024, is up for song of the year. 
At the award ceremony in March he'll receive the Brit Awards' rising star prize – following in the footsteps of Sam Fender, Adele and Rag 'N' Bone Man. 
There are 70 nominees across 13 categories.
Nominations in the three biggest categories are:
Artist of the year
Group of the year
Album of the Year
British artists up for multiple awards this year include Beabadoobee, Central Cee, Chase & Status, Fred Again, JADE, Nia Archives, Michael Kiwanuka, Rachel Chinouriri and Sam Fender.
Coldplay, who headlined Glastonbury last year, have received nominations for group of the year and song of the year with feelslikeimfallinginlove. However, the British band's 10th album - Moon Music - was not nominated for album of the year. 
The international artist of the year category is once again a tough battle with the majority of nominees being female American pop singers. Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan and Billie Eilish are among the nominees.
Roan has just won BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025 – the station's annual poll to identify music's biggest rising stars.
Five genre categories in the Brit nominations are voted for by the public via WhatsApp - alternative/rock; dance; pop ; R&B and hip hop/grime/rap.
Among the nominees in those categories are Raye, who made history at the Brit Awards last year winning six of the seven prizes she was nominated for, and girl group Flo, who were named winners of the rising star award in 2022.

Peterborough City Council was due to vote on proposals to lease part of Werrington Fields to Ken Stimpson Academy at a meeting on Wednesday.
Mayor Marco Cereste said the council had received a letter, which came from the Department for Education (DfE), that ""all councillors need to read and digest before they make any kind of decision"".
He said the matter could then be revisited at the council's next meeting attended by all councillors, currently scheduled for 19 February.
Ken Stimpson Academy has wanted a fence erected since 2019, citing safeguarding concerns as the land has been shared by the public and pupils.
However, local campaigners said the fields had been shared for about 40 years and believed public access should not be heavily reduced.
Peterborough City Council (PCC) proposed that all of the land designated for educational use should be leased to the 4Cs Academy Trust under an 125-year agreement, while a Community Use Agreement would enable some further uses of the playing fields outside school hours.
It also proposed bearing half of the cost of supplying and erecting the fence, estimated to be about £40,000.
The proposals would have been debated by councillors at the meeting, had the decision not subsequently been delayed.
The new letter, which was published online by Peterborough's MP Andrew Pakes, stated that negotiations over the lease were ""not a matter for the DfE"". 
The DfE said in its letter: ""When a school converts to academy status, it is usual practice for all of the land designated as educational use to be made available to the school. However, it is ultimately for the council to agree with the academy trust how much of the land is ultimately leased.""
Mr Pakes wrote on X that this ""has been known all along"" and that the council delaying the decision was ""deeply disappointing"". 
The council has made several attempts to resolve the issue in the past few years.
It agreed last year to allow all of the land called Area C on its map of the fields to be fenced off, but the decision was later overturned.
In 2020, it tried to fence off part of the fields but later admitted it was wrong to do so, saying it was a ""breach of the statutory trust on which the land is held for the benefit of the public"".
A Freedom of Information request from 2024 showed the city council had spent more than £100,000 on the saga.

The plan includes opening new paint facilities in Castle Bromwich, UK and Nitra, Slovakia.
The firm, which is owned by India's Tata Group, says it expects to more than double its bespoke paint operation, including helping clients match the colour of exclusive Range Rover SV models to their private jets or yachts.
It follows a similar move by Rolls-Royce, which announced earlier this month that it was investing £300m to build more highly-customised versions of its cars for super-rich customers.
""Range Rover clients are increasingly choosing to tailor their vehicles with more exclusive bespoke and elevated palette paints,"" said Jamal Hameedi, director of special vehicle operations at JLR.
""By increasing our capacity we can satisfy the demand growth from our Range Rover clients and... clients of our other brands.""
The company says the plan will also help it cut energy and water use as well as reduce paint waste.
Earlier this month, Rolls-Royce said it was expanding its Goodwood factory and global headquarters to meet growing demand for bespoke models.
Rolls-Royce said the plan would ""also ready the manufacturing facility for the marque's transition to an all-battery electric vehicle future"".
Last month, Jaguar unveiled a controversial new electric concept car.
Some on social media said the new Type 00 car was ""exciting"" and ""absolutely stunning"", while others called it ""rubbish"" and told Jaguar's designers to ""go back to the drawing board"".
However, the carmaker suggested the reaction was exactly what it wanted as it was trying to reset the brand and revive sluggish sales.

The developers, LandsecU+I and Town, hoped to submit a planning application for the Hartree development in Cambridge in March.
The development has been dependent on permission being granted for a replacement sewage works, so the homes could be built on an existing waterworks facility.
A decision on the sewage project was due to be issued on 12 January, but was delayed for a second time by the Secretary of State for Environment, Steve Reed, until 14 April.
Anglian Water applied for permission to build the new Cambridge Waste Water Treatment Plant on land north of the A14 at Honey Hill, between Horningsea and Fen Ditton.
Mike Bodkin, head planner at Town, said the Hartree scheme was ""now frozen,"" but if the sewage works relocation was approved, an outline planning application for Hartree would be submitted ""shortly after"".
Some 90% of the homes would be flats, and the development could also include two primary schools, a library, a health hub, sports hall, and two flexible community or culture facilities.
Developers previously claimed there was not a development like Hartree ""anywhere in the world yet"" and it would ""set a new standard,"" the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
On Wednesday, Cambridge City Council and South Cambridgeshire District Council were updated on the plans at joint committee meeting.
Labour councillor at Cambridge City, Katie Thornburrow, raised concerns at ""misinformation"" spread that no cars would be allowed on the development.
Developers confirmed there would be car access, but it aimed to create ""excellent walking and cycling facilities"" to give people the option not to have a car.
They said four mobility hubs were planned around the edge of the site for parking, car club spaces, access to e-bike, bus and other transport.
They added disabled car parking spaces would be created near accessible homes.
Mr Bodkin explained they planned to restrict possible parking places using the  landscaping and a system of fines would be put in place for inappropriate parking.
""We are not dictating who can come and live here, but what we are saying is that, if they want to come live here, they are then buying into the vision,"" he said.
""If they want to live with a car then there will be an additional cost and they will be paying to use a space.""

""My beauty. You're a hero. You're home. That's it,"" her mother says as the three laugh and cry together.
The moment, filmed by the Israeli military, was the first time the family had seen each other in more than 15 months.
Liri was among the first Israelis to be taken hostage in the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack, when the military base on the Gaza border where she was serving was overrun.
She was among four female soldiers to be returned to Israel on Saturday as part of the first phase of a ceasefire agreement with Hamas. Two hundred Palestinian prisoners were released in return.
""The feeling of relief and happiness envelops us after 477 long and unbearable days of nerve-wracking waiting,"" her family said in a statement shortly after her return.
Crowds had gathered in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on Saturday morning, watching a live news feed from Gaza on a large screen as they waited for the group to be brought back to Israel.
Released alongside Liri were soldiers Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa and Naama Levy, all aged 20.
Cheers erupted as the women appeared, flanked by masked gunmen from Hamas's al-Qassam Brigades, for a staged handover in Gaza City's Palestine Square. They held hands and waved, before being taken away in Red Cross vehicles.
""It's amazing. They're amazing. Did you see them stand and smile?"" one woman watching the live feed with the crowd in Tel Aviv said.
In the crowd watching in Gaza, one man told the BBC Hamas was returning the hostages in an ""honourable way"" and declared the moment a victory for the group.
The women were then transferred to the Israeli military and later brought by helicopter to a hospital.

In a press briefing, the director of Beilinson Hospital, Dr Lena Koren Feldman, described the released hostages as being in a ""stable condition"", but said they would continue to be given a ""comprehensive medical and emotional evaluation"".
They were the second group of hostages to be released under a ceasefire deal, aimed at bringing a permanent end to the war, which began a week ago following months of negotiations.
The four women were taken hostage on 7 October from the Nahal Oz military base, about a kilometre from the Gaza border fence.
They were part of an unarmed all-female unit of observers, known as tatzpitaniyot in Hebrew, whose role was to study live surveillance footage captured by cameras along the high-tech fence and look out for signs of anything suspicious.
Several conscripts from the unit and families of those who were killed have said that they had been warning that an attack was coming in the months before 7 October.
It was clear there was a ""balloon that was going to burst"", one told the BBC.
The Israeli military has previously said it is in the midst of a ""thorough investigation into the events of 7 October, including those in Nahal Oz, and the circumstances preceding"".
One woman from the unit, Agam Berger, remains in Gaza. In a statement on Saturday, her family said they were ""overjoyed and moved"" by the return of the four others, while they continued to ""eagerly await embracing Agam, God willing, in the coming week"".
Another woman who served in the unit with them, but was not on shift on 7 October, told the BBC: ""I have been very emotional… This feels like sisters coming home.""
""God willing, we will all sit together and talk, but of course no pressure. They have to heal first.""
For families of the observers who were killed on 7 October, it was a bittersweet moment.
""This is a very emotional day for us,"" said Elad Levy, whose niece Roni Eshel served alongside the four women but was killed in the attacks.
""We are very happy to see Karina, Daniella, Liri and Naama coming back home to their families. At the same time, we remember that there are hostages still in Gaza. And for us, we remember Roni who will never come back home.""
Israel had expected female civilian hostage Arbel Yehud to be included in Saturday's release, and accused Hamas of breaching the terms of the ceasefire to prioritise female civilians. Hamas said Ms Yehud would be released next weekend.
Another female civilian who is yet to be released is Shiri Bibas, who was taken hostage with her husband and two young children, Ariel and Kfir.

109,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz3zzy0z0o,2025-01-25,Protests against plans to close five schools,"Hundreds of people have gathered to protest against council plans to close five primary schools on the Isle of Wight.
Proposals will see schools in Cowes, Arreton, Oakfield, Brading and Wroxall shut from August.
Demonstrators of all ages rallied in Newport against the plans, which unions say have ""terrified"" pupils and will see more than 200 members of staff made redundant.
The local authority previously said it is seeking to address a significant decline in pupil numbers due to a falling birth rate, which is causing a financial strain on the council.
It said nearly there were 1,900 unfilled places in mainstream schools as of October 2023 and it projected that figure to rise to 3,056 by September 2027.
A four-week consultation period is set to come to an end on Friday before the council makes its final decision on the closures in late February or early March.
Mark Chiverton, branch secretary for Unison on the Isle of Wight, said: ""There are over 200 jobs at risk, of both teachers and support staff of various types.
""They are extremely anxious about their futures but also very much concerned about the impact of these proposals on children, on families, particularly those children who may have special needs and be particularly vulnerable.""
The council has said buildings could be repurposed to expand SEND provision on the island.
Peter Shreeve, a member of the National Education Union (NEU) on the island, who was at the protest, said: ""If you listen to our staff, everyone is really worried about their pupils.""
He added that students also spoke at the event and they ""are just terrified"" about the closures.
""They are frightened to move miles away to a new school that they can't walk to, that is probably going to be overcrowded.""

Volunteer-led iCare Peterborough is based at the Khadijah Mosque and Islamic Centre on Cromwell Road, and provides food parcels, hot meals, clothing and advice across the city.
Founder Akeel Khalil started the charity in 2021 and has supported about 60,000 people ""from all walks of lives and communities"" since then.
He said the cost-of-living crisis has ""massively"" contributed to their rise in demand.
iCare Peterborough is a branch of a national organisation run by the United Kingdom Islamic Mission (UKIM).
Mr Khalil recalled starting the city's charity with two volunteers and ""six biryani boxes in our hands looking for homeless people"".
""We started off with surplus food giveaways and from research and speaking to people – we understood there was need for cooked meals,"" he said.
""We then launched a community kitchen and have our own pool of chefs, and run a food bank.""
The charity's volunteers also deliver food and household and baby essentials to those in need with limited mobility or transport issues.
The charity works with Peterborough City Council and operates a weekly community hub at the mosque for families in need.
Mr Khalil said the stigma of seeking help was dwindling due to the ""sheer need"" people were experiencing.
""Everyday we are being contacted by new people and it's frightening,"" he said.
""The stigma does occur. It was worse in 2022 in comparison. But as the cost-of-living crisis deepened, I feel that's gone. 
""People are saying we literally have no food or we need help with baby clothes, or medicines or hygiene items.
""And yes - people are sadly choosing between heating or eating. It is a reality.""
Her said the charity provided ""a welcoming environment"" where dignity and privacy were protected.
""We are supporting people from all walks of life - from babies to elderly people who are lonely and have not had any human contact,"" he added.
Mr Khalil said he felt ""proud"" of the journey and all the volunteers working with iCare.
The charity is looking for more volunteers and support from the community and urged anyone who wanted to help to get in touch.

111,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj34ve0zj9o,2025-01-23,Drivers on laughing gas 'hard for police to catch',"Catching drivers at the wheel under the influence of nitrous oxide can be a ""greater challenge"" than those using other substances, West Midlands' police and crime commissioner has said.
Simon Foster warned the substance - also known as laughing gas - leaves the body quickly and he does not believe a test such as a breathalyser can detect it.
In 2023, 19-year-old driver Thomas Johnson killed three of his friends after he had inhaled the gas at the wheel, before driving his car at speeds up to 100mph and hitting a tree. 
In December, he was jailed for nine years and four months after being convicted of three counts of causing death by dangerous driving.
The case came a year after driver Rohail Jillani inhaled the substance and filmed himself driving at almost 100mph, before he hit bridge, killing Nadia Yusuf, his 17-year-old passenger.
Speaking at a police and crime panel meeting Rashad Mahmood, Labour councillor for Birmingham's Sparkhill ward, also raised concerns over the issue.
""How are we going to tackle the usage of nitrous oxide gas while driving? This has caused fatalities in the last few years,"" Mr Mahmood said.
""And how are we going to tackle the businesses which are selling nitrous oxide gas?""
Mr Foster pointed out that possession of laughing gas had become a criminal offence in late 2023, giving police greater powers against people who had or used the substance.
""However, in terms of being able to regulate the use of nitrous oxide by people who are driving, my understanding it's a greater challenge to do that for nitrous oxide than it is perhaps for other drink and drug-driving,"" he said.
""I don't think there is a test that can be used as there can, for example, in relation to a breathalyser or blood test for drug use.""
He said there were other ways to tackle the issue, for example by working with the likes of trading standards to stop the supply of laughing gas, as well as educating people on the impact on health and the potential consequences of using it.

112,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78wz6dy2y2o,2025-01-25,200 Palestinian prisoners released to jubilant scenes in West Bank,"A total of 200 Palestinian prisoners have been released to jubilant scenes in the West Bank after Israel freed them in exchange for four female hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.
More than half of the 200 released had been serving life sentences in Israeli jails - some were convicted of multiple murders, including the killing of Israeli civilians. Others were never charged with a crime.
Around 70 of the most serious offenders were deported via Egypt to neighbouring countries, including Qatar and Turkey.
A smaller number will be sent to Gaza. The rest - just over 120 - will be allowed to return to their homes in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
""After the conclusion of the necessary activities in the prisons and the approval of political authorities, all the terrorists were released from the Ofer and Ktziot prisons,"" the Israel Prison Service said in a statement.
Some of the released prisoners were hoisted aloft by crowds to loud cheers and fireworks after they stepped off buses.
There was then a scramble as they tried to find their loved ones and family members, before being carried into a sports complex where the celebrations continued.
""Thank God! It's a great feeling, I can't describe this feeling! I've been in jail six years and two months,"" released prisoner Bakker Kwaawish said after he got off one of the buses dressed in grey prisoner fatigues.
The youngest Palestinian prisoner released on Saturday was 16 years old. The oldest, Mohammed al-Tous, was 69. He had spent 39 years in jail, having first been arrested in 1985 while fighting Israeli forces.
Another prisoner, Mohammad al-Ardah, was part of a high profile jailbreak in 2021.
A total of 121 of the prisoners released had been serving a life sentence.
Some of the prisoners had been held for short periods of time, and some were never charged with a crime but were held under something called administrative detention.
The swap on Saturday was the second exchange since a ceasefire came into effect on 19 January. Three hostages and 90 Palestinian prisoners were released in the first swap. 
During last week's prisoner release, there was a noticeable show of support for Hamas, but on Saturday, Fatah, the West Bank's ruling party, which dominates the Palestinian Authority (PA), turned out in force to display their backing for the prisoners.
Earlier on Saturday, four female Israeli soldiers taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October 2023 were released from Gaza.
Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy and Liri Albag, all aged between 19 and 20, were released to the Red Cross in Gaza City during a heavily choreographed handover involving dozens of Hamas gunmen.
However, Israel accused Hamas of breaching the terms of the ceasefire because female civilian hostage Arbel Yehud was not included in Saturday's release.
Israel said it would delay the planned return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza, while Hamas insisted the hostage would be released next weekend.
The January ceasefire deal halted the war which began when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages.
More than 47,200 Palestinians, the majority civilians, have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says.

Storm Éowyn swept across parts of the UK, bringing 96mph (154 km/h) gusts of winds to places like Brizlee Wood in Northumberland.
No trains ran in Cumbria all day, and rail services between England and Scotland were also called off on Friday morning, Network Rail said.
Meanwhile, more than 60,000 homes in the North East and 16,000 properties in Cumbria were affected by power cuts, with some warned electricity may not be restored until Sunday.
An amber weather warning was in place for wind until 21:00 GMT on Friday, with a yellow wind warning continuing in the region until 23:59 GMT.
More than 26,000 homes across the North East were without power as of 18:30 GMT, Northern Powergrid said.
In Cumbria, Electricity North West said it could take until Sunday evening to restore services.
Flights at Newcastle Airport and Teesside Airport were also disrupted, as were ferry services across the River Tyne.
Train services are expected to remain disrupted on Saturday, with ""do not travel"" warnings in place in Cumbria.
Hundreds of schools were closed across Cumbria and Northumberland for safety reasons, along with dozens across the rest of the region.
A section of the A19 northbound was closed earlier from Seaham Grange roundabout to Herrington Interchange in Sunderland due to an overturned lorry.
Northumbria Police said no-one was believed to have been seriously injured and the vehicle had been moved.
Two out of three lanes of the M6 were shut in both directions between junctions 43 and 44 after a collision involving an HGV.
An overturned lorry also led to the partial closure of Redheugh Bridge across the River Tyne.
Both southbound lanes were shut along with one northbound and pedestrians were unable to cross.
The A1 was closed northbound between Clifton and Tranwell in Morpeth, Northumberland, due to a fallen tree.
Carlisle's Sands Centre closed after high winds caused damage to the temporary canopy installed while the auditorium roof is replaced.
The venue will remain closed on Saturday but some roads around it will reopen, the council added.
Some court cases were either postponed or delayed at Carlisle's magistrates' and crown courts due to Scotland-based defendants being unable to safely travel.
School children were also escorted across Eden Bridge after classes, to ensure they were safe.
Carlisle Cathedral has cancelled its public services on Saturday following storm damage.
Sellafield workers were told to work from home if they could. 
The firm said: ""As a precautionary measure, all outside working on the site is restricted... unless in the interests of maintaining nuclear safety or security and subject to risk assessments.""
Forestry England advised people to stay away from its sites in Cumbria, including Whinlatter and Grizedale, ""due to the risk of falling trees"".
Northumberland Country Parks at Bolam Lake, Plessey Woods and Druridge Bay are closed, as are the Beamish and Bowes museums in County Durham.

The public space in Maldon's Promenade Park in Essex has hosted events and performances for the last 20 years.
Maldon District Council says the refurbishment should be complete within three weeks, pending any impact from adverse weather or other unexpected issues.
A spokesperson for the council said the work was necessary ""to enhance its structural integrity, add core strengthening, and improve ground protection on either side as well as improved accessibility"".
They added: ""The current defective structural 'wings' on either side of the main 'tower' will be fully deconstructed.
""This will be followed by a series of civil works for increased drainage and strengthening of the wing reinstatement works.""
The council spokesperson added: ""Both new wings will be comparable and in keeping with what was previously in place, however the depths and heights of the steps will be more user friendly and more accessible. 
""There will also be some differences due to additional ramps leading on to the steps for ease of access.""
They said the amphitheatre was used for events, performances and general community and public use and activities and had endured ""various weather conditions, high foot traffic, and numerous events"".
The council added that the cost of the project would be within existing budgets.

Thousands had signed a petition to save the trees on Clifford Bridge Road but the plans, which includes their felling, were approved in a close-vote by the city council.
The route is designed to be the final stretch of the Binley cycleway linking the city centre with University Hospital.
Members of the council's scrutiny co-ordination committee backed a decision by a senior councillor to approve the two-way path at a meeting on Tuesday. 
Plans for the cycle path have been opposed by many in the local area over the loss of trees and safety concerns. 
Despite the opposition, the designs were signed off by cabinet member Patricia Hetherton at a meeting last month, following three re-designs of the scheme over several years.
Tuesday's meeting was held after members of both political groups on the council demanded more scrutiny of the ruling on the cycle lane.
The plans were challenged by councillors from across the political spectrum.
Council officers stressed the scheme will undergo another safety review by an outside company before work is carried out, adding that the trees are only being felled as a last resort.
Ms Hatherton's decision was backed by the committee by five votes to four.

While the sentencing of Axel Rudakubana for the murders of three children later to an extent concludes what could have been a much longer and more painful legal process, families have said their grieving and healing will continue indefinitely.
One resident, Mike Ainscough, said people would continue to ""tremble"" with worry at the sight of blue flashing lights.
Mr Ainscough, who tended to thousands of flowers and tributes left in the wake of the attack, said while the town will indeed move on, the trauma left behind would mean a sense of worry would always be in the back of people's minds.
He said the whole town ""still grieves greatly"".
""My wife does a two-mile walk but the moment she sees a blue flashing light or if there's been a crunch at the end of the street, her first thought is not it's a car bump, her first thought is 'has something happened again?',"" he said. 
""That is in the back of a lot of people's minds. 
""I would think there are a lot of people in Southport who would tremble when they see blue lights"". 
Yet despite the worry, Mr Ainscough said the town was determined to move on in a positive way and people only have to look at the reaction of the community following the attack to see evidence of that.
He received 300 buckets of flowers, 150 potted plants and 15 sacks of cuddly toys from locals and people visiting from far and wide to offer their support in a ""war-time spirit"", he said. 
""You couldn't buy a bunch of flowers in Southport at one stage,"" he continued. 
""It was an amazing response, it helped people with the grief as well and that's why I tried to maintain it because at least it was something nice."" 
Rae Brooke, chief executive of the community foundation for Merseyside, who helped raise more than £800,000 for families and the local community, agreed the response had been ""incredible"".
She said: ""What has been encouraging is the fact that there has been a quiet dignity here when you think about everything that has happened, the scale of the trauma.
""We have seen people doing exceptional acts of kindness for each other.""
From vigils and services to clean-up operations after the riots that broke out following the attack, to theatre performances and bubble-blowing displays, many events were held to bring the community together. 
But Ms Brooke admitted the community will need time to rebuild and said that ""could take years"". 
Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced on Wednesday people trying to buy knives online will face tougher measures to prove their age as the fallout from the attack continues.
It comes after it emerged that Rudakubana bought a knife from Amazon when he was just 17, despite existing laws which prohibit the sale of most knives to under-18s.
Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said it was a ""total disgrace"" that he was able to buy a knife when he already had a conviction for violence.
However Mike Sammon, a Liberal Democrat councillor for the Cambridge ward in the town, said people's focus should go wider than simply scrutinising how Rudakubana could have been stopped 
Collectively, there needs to be a push to prevent an incident like this ever happening again, he said. 
""We need to focus on how we can make sure this doesn't happen again rather than putting parents through unnecessary anguish of how he could have been stopped,"" the councillor said.
""I don't think he could have been stopped or it could have been predicted, especially not in a town like Southport.
""We have to focus on how we will move forward together and offer the support we can"".

Addressing the defendants, who were 14 and 12 at the time of the attack, he said: ""Things are going to happen quite quickly from now on.""
The trial for both children is scheduled to last up to six weeks and will be heard by a High Court judge.
An inquest into Mr Kohli's death was opened in November and gave a preliminary cause as a neck injury.
His family previously called him a ""loving husband, dad and grandad"" in a statement, adding: ""He was also a son, brother and uncle. He adored his grandkids with all his heart and loved spending time with them.""

Since 2022 Guildford and Waverley borough councils have shared a chief executive and leadership team.
In September a shared planning team was launched.
The report also said future savings could be even greater, now the one-off costs of creating shared teams have been met.
Guildford leader Julia McShane said: ""We are excited about the potential to build on these results to drive further savings.
""As we continue to work together, our priority is to ensure that the services we provide to residents remain efficient and of the highest quality.""
Waverley's leader Paul Follows said: ""Our joint working has allowed us to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and maintain the standards of our services.
""We are in a fantastic position to explore further opportunities for collaboration that will generate additional savings and benefits for both councils and the communities we serve.""
The report also said there had been no fall in the performance of services by either council.
With the government planning to reorganise local government, possibly merging districts and boroughs into larger unitary authorities, Follows said Guildford and Waverley are in a good position.
He said: ""Being able to demonstrate a strong and successful partnership will also enable Guildford and Waverley to make very powerful case for us to have the central role in any future unitary council covering our area.""

Maher Fattouh, 32, lost his sight when a bomb exploded as he crossed the border into Lebanon in 2014 to escape military service under Bashar al-Assad's regime.
After moving to England he earned an English teaching qualification from the University of Cambridge in 2022 before studying for a master's in Psychology of Education in Bristol.
""I'd like to show that a person with massive, massive challenges can live safely and independently and achieve academic excellence,"" Mr Fattouh said. 
Mr Fattouh, from Damascus, was only 21 when he was told he would never see again. 
He could not speak English, and would pay a friend to read to him.
""I'm really proud of owning my story. I lived so many dark periods for so long,"" he said.
""For a long time one of my dreams was just to open a bank account, because I couldn't as a Syrian.""
He shared his story with an audience of 1,000 people during his graduation.
""In my community, the definition of visual impairment is a 'fall into darkness',"" he said.
""You won't be able to manage, you will live dependent on others, you may be excluded, you may lose opportunities and life may be miserable and depressing."" 
Mr Fattouh explained he decided to ""disagree with that definition"" and ""choose an entirely different scenario"".
By 2018, he was teaching other visually impaired people when he received his high school diploma, before moving on to university study in Cambridge and Bristol.
He has now found a job as an academic support officer in London.
Mr Fattouh said he chose to move to Bristol because the cobbles ""feel identical"" to those in Damascus and the city is full of churches and monuments.
""People are so kind here. If I stopped to wait for a taxi, I'd get many people offering to help me cross the road,"" he said.
He said the University of Bristol gave him lots of extra support and he ""loved"" the disability services they offered.
Prof Evelyn Welch, the university's vice-chancellor and president, said: ""Maher is a remarkable man who has shown amazing fortitude and resilience to achieve all he has, despite the challenges he has faced.""
Mr Fattouh has not been back to Syria in more than 10 years but he hopes the change of government will allow him to return to visit family soon.

Alliance group leader on Belfast City Council, Michael Long, said ""there was very little awareness"" of what Belfast 2024 was.
Belfast 2024 was meant to be a year-long ""creative celebration"" for the city, linking a number of shows and events.
In a statement to BBC News NI, Belfast City Council said that ""the vast majority of events within the programme were sold out or nearing full capacity"".

Events held as part of Belfast 2024 included the visit of Little Amal, a 12ft (3.7m) puppet of a 10-year-old Syrian refugee.
Long said there had been ""some fantastic events"".
""But I think the problem more is not necessarily to do with the actual content of the events, it was really to do with whether people knew anything about Belfast 2024,"" he said.
""People in the city weren't necessarily as aware of the issues as they maybe should have been.
""Even now at the end of the year, I think there was very little awareness of what it was.
""Was it actually the game-changer we had hoped in terms of the arts in Belfast?
""Have arts groups felt that it was actually something that was worthwhile given the investment that was made?""
Artists who took part in the Belfast 2024 programme told BBC News NI that it had made an impact.
Kwame Daniels was the creative director of North Star, a large-scale music show commemorating Belfast's opposition to the slave trade.
""That just wouldn't have been possible without the trust, the support of Belfast 2024,"" he told BBC News NI, adding that international guests flew in to see the show.
""As a result of that now there are talks of taking North Star possibly to New York, to Colombia,"" he said.
""We worked with over 100 pupils across four schools, creative writing workshops really interrogating their feelings of the city and home.
""They then performed on stage. In terms of legacy it's huge.
""That year, I believe, really made it cool to be in Belfast. The impact of that you might not feel for four or five years.""
Becky Bellamy is one of those behind The Show Some Love Green House in the city centre - an arts, activism and events space.
They told BBC News NI that Belfast 2024 had part-funded the project.
""Belfast 2024 took a risk on us, took a gamble on us, which I think we have more than paid back in terms the impact that we've been able to deliver with the space,"" they said.
""The most consistent thing that we would get said whenever people would walk in is 'Wow, we can't believe that there's a place like this in Belfast.'
""We're the most chronically underfunded country in terms of the arts and Belfast 2024 was able to provide funding to the arts.
""They were able to empower people to think bigger and do something different.""
But Bellamy said that there were some frustrations with how Belfast 2024 was communicated.
""The marketing that was delivered to be able to share all of the components of the programme and the centralised programme itself was not up to scratch,"" they said.
""It was not reflective of how communications happen in the modern world.""
Long said the council would carry out an evaluation of Belfast 2024 which would address a number of questions.
""Was there enough marketing around the particular project?"" he said.
""Did it attract the number of visitors they were actually wanted?""
In a statement to BBC News NI, Belfast City Council said about 60,000 people had attended or taken part in almost 1,000 events or activities as part of Belfast 2024.
It said the ""vast majority of events within the programme were sold out or nearing full capacity"".
""Over 1,000 contracts were delivered with Belfast artists, production staff, facilitators and designers and more than 200 partnerships and community collaborations were forged,"" the statement continued,"" a spokesperson added.""
""Evaluation of the programme is ongoing and will help identify any learning for future programmes.""
They also said while Belfast City Council had agreed a budget of £5.9m for Belfast 2024, ""a further £460,000 was raised towards the programme from partners, including £250,000 from National Lottery Heritage Fund, £110,000 from the British Council and £100,000 from other councils towards wider Little Amal programme.""

Peter McCormack, who co-owns Real Bedford, said locally he wanted the club to be bigger than Kettering Town, then Northampton, then Milton Keynes, then Luton, ""and ultimately to the Premier League"".
McCormack, who hails from Bedford - about 50 miles (80km) north of London - said the proposed merger with Bedford Town FC was ""about the coming together of two clubs to achieve something for the town"".
He added that ""when we started we had 40 fans and a tiny little stadium"", but ""ultimately I want the town of Bedford to win"".
Bedford Town play in the Southern League Premier Division Central and are based at the Eyrie in Cardington.
Real Bedford are currently top of the division below, Southern League Division One Central, and play at the neighbouring McMullen Park.
In April 2024, Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss invested $4.5m in Bitcoin (about £3.6m) in McCormack's side and became co-owners.
McCormack said: ""I think Wrexham's goal is the Premier League and they are up to League One now and they are backed by Ryan Reynolds and his wealth, but Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are worth twenty times his net wealth and there are two of them.""
He said the ""much stronger"" merged entity would continue to use Bitcoin as a financial tool for the club.
McCormack said: ""The short term goal was always football league for the men's side in ten years.
""If we go up this year that will be three promotions in three years, leaving us with three left to do in seven years and I think that is ambitious, but we think we can do that.""
Regards the merger, he said Bedford Town was ""waiting to hear back from the FA and the Southern League, do they approve it and where they will position the team in the pyramid"".
If it gets approved, McCormack said they would use Bedford Town's ground that has a 3G pitch, which is ""pretty cool"" and ""so we wouldn't lose games due to the weather"". 
Legal agreement for the merger has to be done by the end of March to be ready to merge by the end of the season, he said.
Bedford Town's director Jon Taylor previously said: ""This proposed merger represents a unique opportunity to build on that legacy and take football in Bedford to the next level.""

Joseph Dix, 26, from Frome, Somerset and Macauley Ruddock, 28, from Bath, were jailed for life on Friday, and will serve a minimum of 13-and-a-half years.
Earlier this month Swansea Crown Court heard how the pair knocked Andrew Main unconscious during a fight, and he never recovered from his injuries.
Det Insp Claire Lamerton from South Wales Police said: ""They clearly set out to cause serious injury to their victim, and now will face significant prison sentences for their actions.""
The defendants had pleaded not guilty to murder, but were convicted after a trial.
Mr Main, from Falkirk in Scotland, never regained consciousness after the assault in July 2024, and died from his injuries four weeks later. 
All three involved were visiting Swansea for work and Mr Main had met the pair for the first time at a nearby bar on the evening of the attack on Princess Way.
An argument broke out in the hotel, and spilled into the street where Mr Main sustained his injuries.
""While the parties had all consumed alcohol that night, that does not provide an excuse for the level of violence displayed by Joseph Dix and Macauley Ruddock"" said Det Insp Lamerton.
""This case highlights how the effects of intoxicants can negatively affect behaviour and decision-making."" 
""Had Joseph Dix and Macauley Ruddock chosen to walk away that night, a life would have been saved, and they would not be convicted killers,"" she added.

Sterling Accountant Ltd had applied to convert part of Bridge House, Radford, into 12 one-bedroom apartments.
The building, on 13 Holbrook Lane, is currently listed as the head office of Sterling Accounting Services. 
But plans were submitted in December to convert both its ground and first floor into six self-contained flats.
A cover letter with the proposals stressed only office space at the property would be used for housing and its second floor would not be affected. 
The firm claimed the flats would be a ""much-needed"" boost to Coventry's housing stock through the changes to the building.
However, city council officials said the change of use was not compatible with neighbouring industrial sites and could mean ""unacceptable noise"" for future residents, if they approved the plans.

Speaking at a full council meeting on Wednesday, he called the charges a ""barrier to enjoyment"".
In response, councillor Geoff Hill, said changes to the fees are ""complex"" but said the council would consider it at a later meeting.
Knowles said: ""Street parties and the like are part of British life. People love it.""
He said the council charges residents £189 to apply for permission, £94 to insure an event and £348 to place a notice in a local newspaper.
""I call it a tax on fun, the whole thing,"" he said.
Knowles said he understood that it costs time for officers to put things in place but said he found it ""hard to justify"" the advertising costs to residents. 
Hill, who is responsible for roads in the borough, said there were legal complexities and changes to the council's constitution that would need to be ironed out but he promised to bring the matter to a meeting of council leaders in April.
Knowles agreed to withdraw his proposal.

Engineers are to lay new wheel timbers on the bridge over the River Wey, to the south of Guildford, while upgrades to the track, signalling and level crossings are completed.

Network Rail said the critical upgrades on the North Downs line were for the ""continued safe and reliable running of the railway"".
The new wheel timbers – blocks that carry tracks over bridges – are expected to last 30 years longer than the previous wooden versions.
While that work takes place, the signalling in the area will be modernised, four crossings will have new signalling and barriers installed and trees and hedges will be cut back, Network Rail said.
Route director Mark Goodall said once completed, the line's reliability would be improved and the risk of speed restrictions or closures would be reduced.
""I'm sorry to any passengers whose journeys will be disrupted,"" he said.
""This vital upgrade work will benefit passengers in the long run as they will experience smoother and more reliable journeys.""
During the closure, buses will replace Great Western Railway services operating between and Guildford and Redhill, stopping at all stations. Another bus service will run direct to Gatwick Airport.
Southern and Thameslink trains to and from London, Reigate, Redhill and Gatwick Airport will not be affected.

Norfolk County Council said it reluctantly conceded that the Norwich Western Link - a 3.9-mile (6.3km) section of road to complete the A1270 Broadland Northway into a third ring road - was unlikely to be given a licence for construction.
It said it would continue conversations with the government, which had been advised by Natural England that the road through the Wensum Valley would harm barbastelle bats in the area.
However, the authority said the road remained ""a priority project"".
Both the Woodland Trust and Norfolk Wildlife Trust have both welcomed the move.
Eliot Lyne, the chief executive of Norfolk Wildlife Trust called upon the authority to find a resolution that allowed economic growth without impacting on nature.
""Our primary concern has always been the devastating effect the road would have on the last remaining colonies of the rare and legally-protected barbastelle bat,"" he said.
""With the road looking likely not to go ahead, these vital habitats can remain undisturbed and continue to provide homes, not just for bats but also badgers, owls, linnet, yellowhammers and other wildlife.
""This... shows that by working together to speak up for nature and backed by sound evidence, we can defend and protect Norfolk's incredible wildlife.
'However, it remains disappointing that Norfolk County Council's process and application to build the road did not avoid unacceptable harm to wildlife in the first place.""
The Woodland Trust's Woods Under Threat lead campaigner, Jack Taylor, welcomed the announcement.
He said: ""This is one of the biggest cases affecting veteran trees I have come across during my 10 years at the Woodland Trust. 
""We estimate at least 30 veterans are at risk of loss, but potentially up to 90 facing some form of harm – each one a vitally important habitat for nature, people and the planet.
""This road would drive a stake straight through the heart of Norfolk's precious natural environment and destroy one of our largest colonies of the incredibly rare Barbastelle bat, a creature facing extinction.""
A spokesman for Norfolk County Council said: ""We have made the difficult decision to withdraw the current planning application and prioritise discussions with the Department for Transport on the way forward for the project.
""The Norwich Western Link remains a priority project for this council.""

138,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qj00pnj49o,2025-01-23,Mental health waiting lists 'grow considerably',"An NHS foundation trust said the number of people waiting for mental health assessments had grown considerably due to rising demand.
Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT) said the number of people on waiting lists had increased from 6,700 to 11,600 between December 2021 and December 2024.
A board report being presented to county councillors on Thursday said the body had seen increased referrals for ADHD, autism and eating disorder services in particular.
CPFT said the number of patients waiting for an assessment was below average for the region and that it constantly monitored waiting lists.
The report said: ""Given the substantial increase in demand for mental health services, CPFT has seen its waiting list for assessment grow considerably.""
CPFT highlighted increased demand for eating disorder services – where it received 138 patient referrals a month - saying it faced a ""significant challenge"" in meeting targets to see patients on time.
It said timescales were often not being met for eating disorders because of poor quality initial referral information and difficulties contacting patients to confirm appointments.
CPFT added that it was focusing on ensuring patients could leave hospital when  well enough, pointing out that 14 mental health patients on average each month were ready to leave but delayed.
In December, the NHS trust was rated as ""requires improvement"" for its mental health services for adults of working age. It said at the time that it took the Care Quality Commission (CQC)'s findings ""very seriously"".
The trust's overall rating with the CQC is ""good"".
In the report, CPFT said it had taken on a number of initiatives to focus on suicide prevention, including a ""huge amount of work"" on improving its processes to do with learning from deaths.
Last year, CPFT abandoned plans to review all suicides since 2017, which it announced after a BBC report into the death of 33-year-old Charles Ndhlovu, who had been under the trust's care for two months.
At the time, the trust said it became clear the review could not answer individual concerns.
Thursday's meeting will look at the waiting lists, local treatment, suicide prevention, its finances and priorities for the leadership team.
CPFT said it had reported an annual deficit of £7.23m against a planned deficit of £4.07m.
Steve Grange, who became CPFT's chief executive in October following an interim period after Anna Hills stepped down, is expected to give an update on a new strategic direction for the trust.

About a dozen members of the Oxford Action for Palestine (OA4P) group seized the Radcliffe Camera - which is part of the university's Bodleian Libraries - on Friday morning.
The group said the action had ""become necessary"" after the university ceased contact with OA4P negotiators and remained ""blatantly inactive"".
The University of Oxford said it ""thoroughly condemns the disruption and distress"" caused by the protesters.
It added that students were being advised to avoid the Radcliffe Camera, and to use alternative libraries.
The Bodleian Library said Radcliffe Square had been closed during the protest.
In a statement, OA4P said it ""cannot abide business as usual"" while the university continues its ""deplorable financial and material support"" which ""enabled ruthless Israeli genocide in Gaza"".
The group said it had unofficially renamed the Radcliffe Camera to the Khalida Jarrar Library, after the leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - a group designated a ""terrorist organisation"" by Israel, the US and the European Union.
Jarrar was one one of the 90 Palestinian prisoners released earlier this week as part of the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel.
""The University has shown a clear lack of urgency and resorted to various stalling tactics, despite repeated calls from our broad, diverse, and multifaceted coalition to end its complicity,"" OA4P said.
The group are calling for the University to cut all financial ties with Israel.
In a statement, the University of Oxford said it was ""currently working to safely remove the protestors and ensure that normal studies and services can resume as soon as possible"".
""While the University supports the right to peaceful protest, this action plainly goes beyond the bounds of acceptable protest and is a clear risk to the safety of protestors, students, staff and members of the public,"" it said.
""It is preventing students from using the resources and space of the library to pursue their education.""
""It is also putting at risk on a historic building and its contents.""
OA4P said its efforts ""must be redoubled"" following this week's ceasefire after 15 months of war.
""To take our eyes off of Gaza now would be an abdication of our responsibility to the struggle for Palestinian liberation,"" the group added.
OA4P's action at the Radcliffe Camera follows previous encampments last year around the camera and at the Museum of Natural History.
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage.
Almost 47,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

An inquest was told Donald Mitchell, from St Brides Major, Vale of Glamorgan, died after cycling home from work in December 2020.
The 61-year-old was struck by a blue Volvo S40 travelling in the same direction as him while cycling along the A48 near the Laleston roundabout in Bridgend.
Coroner Patricia Morgan, who was told Mr Mitchell suffered ""catastrophic head injuries"" and was pronounced dead at the scene, called on Bridgend council and the Welsh government to respond to her concerns about a lack of active travel route for cyclists in the area.
Bridgend council said it would be responding to the coroner within the required time scales and the Welsh government has been asked to comment.
Ms Morgan said: ""In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action.""
Donald Mitchell was travelling east between the roundabout and the junction of Well Street when the crash happened on 17 December.
Mr Mitchell had been married to his wife Sian for 34 years and they had three daughters, Hannah, Eluned and Siriol.
Paying tribute, his family said he was a librarian and avid cyclist who was looking forward to his retirement, adding: ""His sad passing is an irreplaceable loss.""

The secondary school pupil missed out on alternative education between January and July 2024 after Dorset Council failings, an investigation by the Local Government Ombudsman (LGO) found.
The LGO also discovered the council's record keeping was ""poor"" and it was unable to provide ""clear, complete and contemporaneous"" documents relating to the case.
Dorset Council's executive director for children's services, Paul Dempsey, said the authority was ""saddened"" that things had gone wrong and accepted the LGO's recommendations.
The investigation found the girl's mother was also impacted as she could not go to work because she had to look after her daughter.
It recommended the girl's mother be given £2,100 in recognition of the alternative provision missed between January and July 2024, and be used for the girl's benefit.
The mother herself will receive £300 from the council as recognition of the ""uncertainty, frustration and distress"" its faults had on her.
""At Dorset Council, supporting children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) is a responsibility we hold with the utmost care,"" Mr Dempsey said.
""Every child has the right to an education and a setting where they can thrive, and we're saddened that this hasn't happened this time.
""In this instance, we have accepted the recommendations and are committed to making changes.""
He said the authority was ""committed to continuing to develop and improve our practice to ensure that this doesn't happen in future"".
""The findings of our recent Ofsted SEND Local Area inspection showed that typically, families in Dorset have a positive experience, and we are making continuous improvements until this is the case for every family,"" he added.

Fundraisers said they hoped work to restore the deteriorating Wells Cathedral grand organ would begin in 2026, ensuring its future for decades to come.
The Friends of the Wells Cathedral, who started the fundraiser, said 25% of the instrument was not playable and would not be so until it is rebuilt.
Group chairman David Morgan-Hewitt: ""It's not a small ask, £2m - the top donor has given £250,000, for which we are extremely grateful.""
Mr Morgan-Hewitt added: ""There are lots of people who have given all sorts of amounts, down to £25 to sponsor a single pipe.""
The Dean of Wells Cathedral, the Very Reverend Toby Wright, added that the organ was in a ""rapidly deteriorating state"" and it needed to ""urgently"" be restored.
He said: ""Until now, our wonderful organists have masked the decline of the organ's performance, concealing its flaws from the ears of the thousands of people who come each year to attend cathedral services, recitals and concerts.""
Having achieved its first £1m, members of the appeal committee said they would now be focusing efforts on raising the second £1m.

153,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-66775985,2025-01-23,How dangerous are XL bullies and how does the ban work?,"It is a year since strict rules about owning XL bully dogs were first introduced in England and Wales. 
The restrictions now cover the whole of the UK, but there have been a number of attacks involving the dogs - some fatal - since the laws were put in place.
Police seized almost 2,000 suspected banned dogs in the first eight months of 2024, and destroyed more than 800, according to BBC research. 
An XL bully is the largest kind of American bully dog. 
The UK government published guidance to help identify XL bullies, which are not recognised as a specific breed.
They are described as large dogs ""with a muscular body and blocky head, suggesting great strength and power for [their] size"".
Male XL dogs stand from 20in (51cm) high at the shoulder, with female XLs only slightly smaller.
There are no official figures for the number of XL bullies in the UK, but dogs are considered XLs if they meet the minimum height and a substantial number of other characteristics.
NHS consultant Richard Baker said the dogs' powerful jaws inflict more damaging wounds than those of other breeds, resulting in broken bones, shredded skin and damaged nerves.
""It's a crushing or a tearing injury,"" he said. ""Once they grip, they don't let go.""
There were 10,924 hospital admissions for dog bites in England in 2023-24, according to the latest full-year NHS data, up from 9,424 in 2022-23.
According to NHS Wales, there were 614 admissions caused by someone being bitten or struck by a dog in 2023-24, compared to 765 the year before.
Public Health Scotland figures record 1,105 admissions caused by dog bites in 2023-24, up from 940 in the previous 12-month period.
According to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), as at 18 October 2024, there had been seven deaths as a result of dog attacks since the start of the year. There were 19 deaths in 2023, and six in 2022. 
However, official figures do not break down the number of attacks or deaths by type of dog.
When the previous government announced the XL bully ban for England and Wales in late 2023, it said the breed had been ""disproportionately involved"" in deaths recorded since 2021.
In several cases, XL bullies are known to have killed their owners, including David Daintree, 53, in August 2024, and Angeline Mahal, who was in her 50s, in May 2024. 
Nicholas Glass, 33, also died in August after being attacked by four dogs - including two XL bullies.
Other people killed by XL bullies include 10-year-oldsSavannah BenthamandJack Lis,68-year-old Esther Martin, 54-year-old Ian Langley, 52-year-old Ian Price, 65-year-old Ann Dunn and 17-month-old Bella-Rae Birch.
Ownership of American bully XL dogs is restricted under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. 
Since 31 December 2023, it has been against the law to sell, give away, abandon or breed from an XL bully.
Since 1 February 2024, it has been a criminal offence to own an XL bully without an exemption certificate.
The government received 61,000 exemption applications before the deadline. 
Anyone choosing not to keep their XL bully had to take it to a registered vet to be euthanised by 31 January 2024.
Owners who applied for an exemption had to buy insurance, microchip their dog and pay £92.40 per animal. 
Registered dogs must be housed securely, neutered and kept on a lead and muzzled in public - but not at home. 
Police can seize unregistered prohibited dogs, and their owners face up to six months in jail and/or an unlimited fine. 
Similar restrictions have applied in Scotlandsince 23 February 2024.
Owners who wished to keep their dogs had to apply for an exemption by 31 July.
In Northern Ireland, American XL bullies have had to be muzzled and kept on a lead in public since 5 July 2024.
The deadline to register for an exemption was 31 December 2024.
The requirements for owners of exempt XL bullies are the same across the whole of the UK.
Anyone breaking the rules in Scotland or Northern Ireland faces up to six months in prison and/or a fine of up to £5,000. 
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Justice, in the year to June 2024 - which includes several months after the new rules began - 772 people in England and Wales were prosecuted for allowing a dog to injure another person in a public place. 
There were 628 convictions. 
That compares to 628 prosecutions and 498 convictions in the 12 months to June 2023. 
Enforcing the new rules has sharply increased police costs, according to Chief Constable Mark Hobrough, the National Police Chief Council (NPCC) lead for dangerous dogs. 
In December, Freedom of Information responses from 20 police forces in England, Wales and Scotland showed that in the first eight months of 2024:
These figures refer to all banned breeds, not just XL bullies. 
The chief constable said kennel and veterinary bills had risen from £4m in 2018 to £25m between January and August 2024 as a result of the new legislation. 
That figure does not include the cost of training staff, buying extra vehicles and equipment, or the wider operational costs of policing more dangerous dogs, he added. 
Breed-specific bans do not work and are unfair on responsible dog owners and their pets, according to the Dog Control Coalition. 
The body includes Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, the Dogs Trust, the Kennel Club, the RSPCA and the British Veterinary Association. 
The group wants a complete overhaul of the Dangerous Dogs Act, including tougher penalties for owners who fail to control their dogs.
Four other breeds are banned in the UK under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991:

154,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8ed6e4l29lo,2025-01-25,Growth at all costs? Why Reeves is in a sudden rush on the UK economy,"Rachel Reeves is suddenly in a rush.
She'd hate the comparison, but the way she's been talking over recent weeks sounds more like a Conservative chancellor. 
She wants to get rid of barriers to business and make it harder for green groups to put the brakes on big development. She's easing off plans to make life more expensive for wealthy non-doms – and is expected to approve new airport runways and cut welfare. 
It doesn't sound much like Reeves' Budget in October, in which she raised whopping taxes, increased spending on public services and reminded us, time and time again, how much trouble the economy was in and how the Conservatives – she claimed – had left that fabled £22bn black hole.
So why the switch in focus?
Treasury insiders say in private that almost as soon as she sat down after the Budget, she was banging the table with officials and pushing for more ideas to get the economy growing. After all, she and Sir Keir Starmer always said growth was their priority.
The plan for her big speech next Wednesday – in which she is expected to unveil more changes to cut back planning rules and announce a new runway at London's Heathrow – was hatched back then, and she's only come under more pressure since to respond to the howls of business. 
One City source told me: ""Labour did a great job of pretending to be pro-business up until [the Budget]. No one would say they are now.""
Ouch!
The metrics that measure how the government is doing in their touted top priority – making the UK more prosperous – are patchy at best, and bleak at worst. We had a wobble in the markets and warnings of a ""doom loop"" on the way. 
Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.
As one FTSE chief executive told me: ""There's been nervousness about this year, sentiment has definitely got worse, with a lack of a positive drum beat.""
There's also been ""argy bargy"" with the unions, one union leader told me, with ""robust conversations"" about the best way to get the economy going, and where to spend public money to support growth. ""The bottom line is that growth is anaemic – they need to massively invest,"" they say.
And although wages are up, any pollster will tell you swathes of voters feel hard up and hard done by.
Inside Number 11, there's a suggestion that the jitters have been helpful, because it's restored a ""sense of urgency and put the focus back on the Treasury"".
Sources say it's enabled Reeves to make the argument more strongly to her colleagues for things like another runway at Heathrow. 
Others also say Reeves' new push reflects that she and the rest of the Cabinet are no longer apprentices, and are settled into their roles.
The need to ""move at speed is much clearer"", a senior source told me. Another said ""the market wobble brought that frustration to the fore – we talked about growth for a long time… I think its begun to put rocket boosters under that"".
But didn't Starmer's tribe tell you and me hundreds of times in opposition that they were ready to hit the ground running? The evidence from their first months in government is that wasn't exactly true and that masterplan we were told existed wasn't real after all.
A Whitehall source said ""they lost time because the preparing for government team wasn't really preparing for government - they had the opportunity to come in and show what they were made of and they fluffed it"", leading to a ""meandering approach"".
Now, they say, ""this is a correction"", a response to business screaming at them and the arrival of ""the orange man in the White House"".
Shifting gears isn't easy, a senior Labour MP said. ""The levers you pull don't just connect to something – the dead hand of the Treasury can't simply control economic growth.""
You'd be forgiven if this sudden rush of positivity and love for swashbuckling business feels a bit confusing. 
Broadly speaking, the government has taxed, spent and borrowed heavily, even though they say they want to concentrate on growing the economy. 
They say now they want to sweep away rules - but at the same time they are increasing regulation for employers to give workers more rights, on landlords, and even want to regulate football. And on green energy, plans for a national energy company are a huge state intervention. 
To help get growth going, ministers would point to planning changes, or their plan to woo big AI companies, even though none other than Sir Paul McCartney notes that's far from straightforward. 
No government's measures can be neatly organised into one set of harmonising ideas. 
The big picture is tough. The country's debts are massive and taxes are huge. Growth is measly. Ministers are scrambling to find places to squeeze their budgets.
In government, there's a belief that better news on wage growth and a tolerable level of inflation has been under-acknowledged. Tomorrow in our studio, and in her big speech on Wednesday, Reeves will try to give you the impression that she is brimming with optimism and in a hurry to get the economy going, so that jobs can be created, the government's tax coffers filled and, ultimately, voters might regain a long-lost feel-good factor.
Yet however upbeat she is a former Labour minister wonders: ""How long will it take for changes to drip through the doorsteps of my constituency where people are living in crowded rented flats, and can't afford the supermarkets?""
The pressure is on. One union leader calls this a ""cross your fingers behind your back moment"". Change takes time and the economy might need patience – but politics isn't always prepared to wait.

The road will be cordoned off between 18:00 GMT on Saturday and 06:00 on Monday, with diversions in place.

It is unclear when the new crossing will be put in place, the Labour-led council said.

North Northamptonshire Council (NNC) will review plans for the 161 acre (65 hectare) site on Nunnery Farm, near Rothwell, which applicant Harworth Estates Investments Ltd claimed would create 3,000 full-time jobs and generate £238m for the local economy each year.
It would comprise of five large warehouses and three smaller units, which would be accessed via Harrington Road.
The application has been lodged despite backlash from people living nearby.
As reported by the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the proposal prompted the creation of local campaign group Rothwell Against Warehousing (RAW), which has about 400 members on Facebook.
The developer held a consultation with residents prior to submitting the application at the end of last year. A survey, which attracted more than 500 responses, found about 75% of people were strongly opposed to proposals.
One person wrote in their objection to Conservative-controlled NNC that ""Rothwell does not need this development, traffic pollution or noise"".
In its planning statement, Harworth Estates said the plans could address a ""limited"" employment offering in Rothwell.
It said: ""The proposed development will therefore respond to this demand for a range of skilled employment positions, as well as providing lower skilled and more flexible entry positions.""
Rothwell Town Council will meet to discuss the application at a meeting on Thursday before submitting its response to NNC.
Public comments on the application will remain open until 14 February, with a final decision on the plans due in April.

The Labour Pontypridd MS, previously a government senior legal adviser, said it was ""time for fresh blood, new energy and new progressive ideas"".
Antoniw revealed last month he had suddenly lost the vision in one eye and underwent sight-saving surgery after waking up with ""cloudy"" vision.
Joyce Watson, MS for Mid and West Wales also announced on Friday she would not be standing in 2026.
Meanwhile, Dawn Bowden, Children and Social Care minister and MS for Merthyr Tydfil, announced on 17 January that she too would not be standing. 
Antoniw, 70, a former counsel general and minister for the constitution, is of Ukrainian origin and well known for his support for Ukraine in its war with Russia.
A Ukrainian speaker, he has paid regular visits to the country delivering aid since it was invaded by Russia nearly two years ago.
Before being elected to the Senedd in 2011, which was then known as the Welsh Assembly, he worked as a solicitor.
On Friday, he issued a written statement thanking his constituents for their support over the years, saying it had been the ""greatest honour of my life"" to serve them.
""It is with a heavy heart that I have decided not to seek re-election in 2026,"" he said. 
""By the time of the next elections in May 2026 I will have served for 15 years. 
""This is on top of 35 years work as a trade union lawyer. 
""I will be approaching 72 years of age and have come to the view that now is the time for fresh blood, new energy and new progressive ideas for the future of Wales and the people of Pontypridd and our new constituency.""
Antoniw said he would ""continue to be politically active, particularly in the field of equality, human rights, constitutional reform and international issues"" after leaving the Welsh Parliament.
The May 2026 poll will see the Senedd expand from the current 60 to 96 members elected using a more proportional electoral system.
There will be 16 larger constituencies with 6 members each chosen via a closed list voting system.
Antoniw had an important role in designing those changes, under former first minister Mark Drakeford.
Ms Watson, who was first elected to Cardiff Bay in 2007, said serving the Labour Party had ""been the privilege of my life"", but she had ""taken the very difficult decision"" not to stand in 2026.
Ms Watson is founder of the Welsh Parliament's anti-human trafficking group and champions the White Ribbon campaign against domestic violence.
In November 2023 she apologised for comments where she suggested farmers hit with perpetual bovine tuberculosis (bTB) infections should ""find another business"". 
In her resignation statement she said she had ""tried to make a difference to people's lives"" during her time in government. 
""The next election, under new rules and boundaries, will be transformative,"" she added.
""It feels like the right time for me to step aside and for new candidates, and to devote more time to my wonderful family.""

Hundreds attended the services at Christ Church in Yardley Wood and St Peter's Church in nearby Hall Green.
The vigils come a day after a 14-year-old was charged with Leo's murder as well as six unconnected assaults and possession of a bladed article
West Midlands Police confirmed on Saturday that Leo's alleged killer, who cannot be named due to his age, was remanded in custody to appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Monday.
Sunday's services were an opportunity for the churches to ""unite with the whole community to surround Leo and his family and friends with our love and prayers"", according to a social media post issued by St Peter's.
They provided well-wishers the opportunity to lay flowers and light candles in memory of Leo.
Speaking at a Sunday service held before the prayer vigil, St Peter's vicar Martin Stephenson said: ""There is a certain solemnity in our community at this time, after the tragic and appalling killing of Leo Ross.
""Our hearts, and our prayers, our love pours out for his family and friends.""
Leo, described as a ""lovely and bright"" pupil at the Christ Church, Christ Church C of E Secondary Academy in Yardley Wood, died in hospital on Tuesday after being stabbed in The Shire Country Park as he walked home.
The school confirmed that the boy charged with murder was not among its pupils and had not studied there previously.
Meanwhile, a GoFundMe fundraising page set up by a relative of Leo's foster carers to raise funds for The Daniel Baird Foundation, an anti-knife crime charity, has attracted donations of almost £10,000.
The foundation was set up after Mr Baird, 26, was fatally stabbed in the Digbeth area in 2017. 
It works to raise awareness of the importance of publicly accessible bleeding control packs.

The project is a co-production by The Museum of Cambridge and the Rowan Humberstone arts centre.
It was made possible after receiving a a £99,802 grant from the Esmée Fairbairn Collections Fund through the Museums Association.
Rowan chief executive Cherie Evans said the aim was to tell ""often unheard stories of disabled people in Cambridgeshire - past, present, and future"".
""This project will provide an opportunity for our artists to explore their unique experiences of living life with a disability and to express this experience through their own stories and art,"" she continued.
""We believe that contributing to this research project based in their own city will give our community a voice and an opportunity to be at the forefront of their own histories.""
The museum, which tells the story of 300 years of Cambridgeshire history and heritage, said disabled people would be at ""the forefront of researching, curating, and sharing"" their histories.
Their stories are already present in its collection of more than 40,000 everyday objects, including family photographs showing people with disabilities, workhouse records and objects made by craftspeople with disabilities.
But organisers said there was ""little institutional research conducted on disabled experiences within the museum's collection"" and the project would ""take vital steps toward more equitable storytelling"".
Alex Smaridge, engagement and collections manager, said: ""This project is a pivotal step for the Museum of Cambridge, placing disabled people in the storytelling seat of disabled histories.
""We're proud to collaborate with Rowan Humberstone to ensure these stories are told with authenticity, respect, and lasting impact.""
Organisers hope the project will inspire other institutions in the UK to take up similar collaborative models.

They have started a petition for the changes to be made in Bernard Street, Southampton.
It says the road is ""supposed to be a 30mph speed limit and not 60mph which is often the case"".
Southampton City Council said there were plans for a 20mph speed limit in Bernard Street and were seeking funding to pay for it. 
The e-petition was submitted on the local authority's website, with residents demanding the lower limit which has already been introduced in other areas across England.
New 20mph limits have been put into force across Oxfordshire, with plans being considered to extend them in some towns, such as Bicester.   
The Bernard Street petition claims the city council has allowed part  of the Old Town to become a busy inner city thoroughfare for all traffic. 
""Over the years this has become so busy it is affecting the health and safety of all residents,"" it said. 
""Although the area has been tidied up, the traffic situation remains a serious problem.""
In recent years, 20mph speed limits have been introduced across Southampton, including in Bassett, St Denys, Old Redbridge, Shirley, Woolston and Weston.
These were in addition to the city centre and roads near to some schools.
Last year Southampton City Council confirmed it was considering reverting some of the 20mph roads in Shirley and Freemantle back to 30mph.
Eamonn Keogh, cabinet member for environment and transport, welcomed the Bernard Street petition.

Southern Water has apologised for the inconvenience and disruption and said it was bringing in tankers to pump water in and looking to deliver water to all of those affected.

The piece of vertebra is said to have come from a dinosaur discovered about 150 years ago in Swindon, which experts have said is the UK's most complete stegosaur skeleton.
It will be on display at Museum & Art Swindon on Euclid Street.
Swindon Borough Council councillor Marina Strinkovsky said: ""It's fantastic that a piece of it is coming home.""
The fossil was first found in the quarry pit at Swindon Brick and Tile Company in 1874, a site now occupied by Halford's and The Range on Fleming Way.
While most of the Swindon Stegosaur remains on display at the Natural History Museum in London, smaller parts were taken by fossil hunters and dispersed into other collections.
""Swindon was really important in the history of palaeontology and loads of important fossil hunters lived here or visited Swindon in the late 19th Century to look for specimens,"" Ms Strinkovsky said.
""The stegosaur ignites the imagination of Swindonians of all ages,"" she added.
Stegosaurs were large, armoured, herbivorous dinosaurs that lived roughly 150 million years ago.
The latest artefact to join the council-run museum was found by palaeontologist Dr Neville Hollingworth and Sally Hollingworth, who have been working alongside museum volunteers and staff through the Arts Council England-funded 'Unlocking Collections' project.
The pair said: ""We saw this specimen for sale and realised its importance straight away.
""When the Swindon Stegosaur was collected in the 19th Century some of the original material ended up in private collections and we instantly recognised that the vertebra offered for sale had come from the original site where the skeleton was found.
""We're delighted that Museum & Art Swindon has put this truly unique find from the town on display and, hopefully, this will help raise awareness about the town's Jurassic past,"" they added.

This was while about 1,500 trees with ash dieback disease were felled and fencing was installed to support a stretch of ""dilapidated"" dry stone walls. 
The Peak District National Park Authority said on Friday: ""Due to recent tree safety and maintenance work being completed around two weeks ahead of schedule, the full through-route of the Monsal Trail will be available once again from this weekend.""

Days after the work started earlier this month, the authority issued a safety warning after dozens of people accessed the trail while it was closed.
Now the Thornhill Trail - which runs from the north of Thornhill Lane to Yorkshire Bridge - is due to close on Monday until 14 February on weekdays only.
The authority said this was also for public safety while essential ash dieback management, including tree felling across the route itself and timber removal, was carried out.

River levels in Shropshire, Staffordshire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire are expected to rise due to heavy wind and rain overnight.
The Environment Agency issued eight flood alerts and one flood warning in the region - with low-lying land expected to be hit the hardest.
It asked people to avoid using footpaths and bridges near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low-lying roads near rivers.

Officials had called a 07:30 GMT precautionary inspection after 10mm of rain on Sunday afternoon, with strong winds and further rain forecast overnight.
However, an earlier decision was made with the track not raceable due to flooding on a bend and further areas of standing water.
The Environment Agency issued a flood warning for the River Teme at Stanford Bridge in Worcestershire. 
It said river levels are rising at the river gauge with a risk to property, roads and farmland.
""Flood water could be deep and fast-flowing, and therefore pose a risk to life.

168,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd9zmqr1l2o,2025-01-24,Big cat park owner banned from keeping animals ,"A big cat sanctuary owner has been banned from keeping animals for five years after being convicted of multiple animal welfare charges.
Terrence Moore, 78, director of the Cat Survival Trust in Welwyn, Hertfordshire, was found guilty of four charges of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal, at St Albans Crown Court in May. 
He was banned from keeping animals, but it was suspended while efforts were made to rehome the remaining 28 animals. 
A later hearing was adjourned after he was injured at the site in November, but the ban was formalised at the court on Thursday.
Moore was also found guilty of seven charges of using an animal species for commercial gain without a licence. 
He was cleared of eight charges of causing unnecessary suffering of an animal and four of using an animal species for commercial gain without a licence.
The judge, recorder David Mayall, said he would order him also to pay fines totalling £10,000.
The four animals he was prosecuted for were a male European wildcat, called Hamish, that had come from a zoo in Paris, a female Bengal cat named Jasmine, a jungle cat called Lily and an unnamed Caracal cat.
Hertfordshire Police said it worked with North Herts Council, Hertfordshire Zoo,  and its sister site The Big Cat Sanctuary in Ashford, Kent, to vaccinate, feed, clean, and care for the 28 animals at Moore's site. Five had to be euthanised. 
The remaining 23 have all been rehomed, including an Asian golden cat called Frank, a fishing cat called Boson, who both now live at The Big Cat Sanctuary and Freddie, a Eurasian lynx who is now at Shepreth Wildlife Park, Cambridgeshire. 
Moore started the sanctuary, which is now closed, in the 1970s with his wife.
It was not a zoo, and not open to the general public, but if someone became a member of the trust, they could access the site.
Police said that Moore had not had a vet visit the site in years, and a homeopathic product was used to treat some of his animals. 
Food preparation, storage and disposal did not appear to be carried out hygienically and the housing of the animals was inadequate and in some cases insecure.
""Several animals were suffering from diseases for which Moore had not sought any veterinary care,"" the force said.
In total, officers seized about 26 carcasses from freezers that were used to store animals for long periods of time when they should have been cremated. 
Det Con Beth Talbot, who led the investigation, said: ""Terrence Moore knew how endangered these species were, understood their vulnerability to exploitation and should have been there to protect them. 
""However, several animals at the site were in a sorry state and suffered at the hands of a man who should have looked after them.""
Jan Muller, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said Moore's actions led to animals to ""suffer unnecessarily"". 
""These animals were forced to live in squalor and Moore neglected them to such an extent that some died from illnesses that could have been treated,"" she said.

169,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7dg1r97dgo,2025-01-27,Girl's Auschwitz survival retold in drama,"The story of a 13-year-old girl who escaped death at Auschwitz by lying about her age is being retold as a drama.
Milton Keynes-based theatre company Voices of the Holocaust is depicting the life of Hungarian survivor Susan Pollack, who was sent to the notorious Nazi camp in 1944 in German-occupied Poland.
A prisoner on the railway platform whispered to Susan that she should pretend to be 15, which meant she was chosen for labour instead of being sent to the gas chambers.
Eighty years after Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated, artistic director of Voices, Cate Hollis, said it was ""apparent that survivor testimony was the strongest approach to help young people connect"".
More than 30,000 people, including thousands of school children, have watched the play - entitled Kindness - and learned about Susan's story.
On arriving at Auschwitz, she was separated from her family, with her mother being sent straight to the gas chambers.
""There were no hugs, no kisses, no embrace. My mum was just pushed away with the other women and children. The dehumanisation began immediately. I didn't cry, it was as though I'd lost all my emotions,"" Ms Pollack previously said.
The girl was moved to Guben in Germany to work as a slave in an armaments factory, before being freed by the British Army on 15 April 1945.
After World War Two ended, she discovered more than 50 of her relatives had been killed, with only her brother surviving.
""The vast majority of pupils will never go to a place like Auschwitz to feel what the biggest graveyard on the planet is like, but this piece of theatre can bring that to every single young person,"" said Ms Hollis.
She founded Voices of the Holocaust to create ""best practise theatre designed as a springboard for Holocaust education"".
She said as Holocaust survivors grew older, ""they're all acutely aware they don't have a great deal longer to ensure the Holocaust is learned about, and learned from"".
Susan's story is not the first to be retold by Voices, which has been dramatising the experiences of Holocaust survivors since 2012.
The company is working towards a new production featuring the life of Harry Olmer, 97, who survived concentration camps in Plaszow and Buchenwald.
Harry was one of 732 children taken in by the UK after the war, since most of his family had been killed.
""One thousand were permitted entry, but so few children survived that they were unable to reach the quota,"" said Ms Hollis.
""Harry recuperated at Windermere until going on to make a life for himself in the UK. His story is critically important and must never be forgotten.""
'Kindness' is being performed at JFS Theatre in Kenton, Harrow, London on Monday at 19:30 GMT, to mark Holocaust Memorial Day.

170,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd9e6m1v1jo,2025-01-27,Bash-prone bridge to get camera system fitted,"One of the most bashed bridges in the country is to be fitted with a camera monitoring system this spring.
The two-metre-high (6ft 6in) bridge at Stonea - between Chatteris and March in Cambridgeshire - carries the main Ely to Peterborough railway line.
Last year it was named joint second most-bashed bridge in Britain by Network Rail with 17 official strikes, although locals claimed the figure could be double because of unreported collisions.
Cambridgeshire County Council said it was working with Network Rail and a rail consultation firm to install cameras to monitor the site 24 hours a day.
James Fuller, 32, has lived on the B1098 Stonea Road for three years.
He said that as well as being too low, the Stonea underpass is not wide enough for two vehicles to pass each other, despite a 50mph speed limit.
""I think it is a waste of time, energy and money to be quite honest,"" he said.
""The cameras will be able to see what the traffic is doing, but they are not going to work out why drivers are repeatedly getting into trouble here.""
""The other day I saw a police van that stopped before going through the underpass,"" Mr Fuller added. 
""A policeman had to get out of the passenger seat and walk the vehicle through, so if the police don't know the size of their van, what chance have the public got?""
Cambridgeshire Police responded that ""there are no set rules or answers to that question"".
Joanna Sidgwick, 57, has lived in Stonea all her life and said she would not like to see the underpass close.
""When the underpass shut for bridge repairs a few years back the traffic was horrendous, it was stacked down the road for hundreds of metres,"" she said.
""You'd see lorry drivers getting out of their cabs to urinate on the side of the road, the noise, the fumes it was awful. 
""I requested the cameras last year, they will be a real benefit.""
Cambridgeshire County Council said the new cameras would monitor the location and collect data, such as general traffic information and near misses. 
""The cameras will provide a live video feed and 24/7 recordings,"" it said.
It added: ""There have been no injury collisions in this location since a number of road safety improvements were made in the autumn of 2023.""
The council is working with Network Rail to try to reduce the number of bridge strikes which continue to occur. 
The total cost of these works is, as yet, unknown.

171,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20kz4591w2o,2025-01-27,New road safety and travel commissioners appointed,"Two people have been appointed to new roles to improve road safety and increase cycling and walking across the West Midlands region.
They will work with a new transport task force being set up through the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA).
The roles have been created after campaigners called for action due to the number of deaths on roads and speed limits to be cut.
The new road safety commissioner is Mat MacDonald, former chair of a road safety campaign group and NHS doctor. Beccy Marston, who has worked with charities, communities and councils, becomes the active travel commissioner.
They will be expected to work one day a week and be each paid £10,000, which is about £200 per day, for their contributions.
Last month, West Midlands Mayor Richard Parker said he was ""blown away"" by the standard of applicants, and had received about 300 applications.
The pair will work towards making roads in the region safer while encouraging more people to choose cycling and walking for shorter journeys, improving the  environment and reducing traffic congestion, Mr Parker said.
The key target, set out in the WMCA's Regional Road Safety Strategy, was to reduce the numbers of people killed or seriously injured on our roads by half by 2030.
At a protest in Birmingham last July, campaign group Better Streets for Birmingham said at least 23 people had died on city roads in a year and called for speed limits to be lowered.
Mr MacDonald, former chair of the group who also has experience supporting victims of road collisions in his NHS role, said being appointed to the new role was a privilege and he looked forward to working towards that target. 
""Achieving this vital objective is the least we owe – not only to the victims of the tragic crashes on our streets, but also to the future generations of the West Midlands, whose safety and happiness is critical to realising the exceptional potential of our remarkable region,"" he said.
The region's Local Transport Plan has set a target for everyone to be able to safely reach a range of local destinations on foot, in a wheelchair or on a bike or scooter, with the aim of at least half of all trips being made by active travel by 2030, Mr Parker said.
Ms Marston said: ""By working hand-in-hand with communities and grassroots organisations, we aim to bring our new infrastructure to life and help individuals experience the practical benefits of walking or cycling for everyday journeys.""
She added that she understood walking and cycling may not work for everyone but it was their ""collective responsibility to make these options safer, more accessible, and easier, helping them become the natural and preferred choice for short journeys"". 
Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Foster, who chairs the West Midlands Road Safety Strategic Group, welcomed the appointments, adding reducing  number of people ""tragically and avoidably killed"" remained a priority.

Andrew Boswell, a former Green Party councillor, has been involved in numerous legal challenges against A47 safety schemes and claimed the planning system does not work to protect nature or the climate. 
In a comment piece published in the Daily Mail on Thursday, Sir Keir Starmer said ""Nimbys and zealots"" had tried to stop the government from ""building the infrastructure the country needs"". 
The BBC has contacted the prime minister's office for comment. 
Sir Keir Starmer opened his comment piece by saying a former Green Party councillor had spent years trying to block ""vital"" schemes. 
He said: ""So why was he able to waste years of the court's time and squander tens of millions of pounds of taxpayer money?
""There are countless more examples of Nimbys and zealots gumming up the legal system often for their own ideological blind spots to stop the government building the infrastructure the country needs."" 
Within the piece, Starmer also hit out at other activist groups who had prevented the development of an East Anglia wind farm for more than two years and another group which delayed the Sizewell C nuclear power project in Suffolk. 
While he did not name Dr Boswell, the former Green Party councillor, said it was a ""dangerous article"" and a ""low-level attack"". 
Dr Boswell believed he has been ""widely supported"" in a number of his legal bids, such as stopping the dualling of the A47 between Blofield and North Burlingham and environmental concerns of the Norwich Western Link. 
The project, which would cost £274m, would have connected the Northern Distributor Road (NDR) to the A47. 
However, the plans were withdrawn by Norfolk County Council after Natural England changed rules protecting rare Barbastelle bats that lived on the route of the proposed road. 
Dr Boswell said: ""I'm not doing it for myself... I am doing it for my grandchildren.
""I am also doing it for nature and if we just let this erosion of nature go on in this country and the erosion of the climate targets then our kids won't have a decent place to live.
""I was fighting for the right cause to stabilise the climate system. I may have lost at this point but I was fighting for the right cause. That money was worth it because of that.""

The training exercise will see multiple agencies - both local and national - come together across the region on Monday, with an event also being held at the Trent Bridge cricket ground in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire.
Nottinghamshire Police said the exercise was not in response to any ""specific threat or intelligence"", but was part of a regular testing and exercising programme.
Regional assistant chief constable Diane Coulson, from East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU), said: ""Fortunately, terror incidents are rare, however we are better prepared than ever to respond when required.""
It is being coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing East Midlands (CTPEM), which is part of a national network of units dedicated to responding to the threat of terrorism.
The scenario will test the way police and partners react to ""challenging, dynamic situations"" - including ambulance and fire teams, which would also have key roles in the event of a terror incident.
Assistant chief constable Coulson said: ""Testing response planning is something that takes place regularly across all emergency services and is a vital way of ensuring we are as prepared as possible to respond to a major incident such as a terror attack.
""Not only do exercises such as this help to ensure all services understand each other's roles, but they also provide an opportunity to highlight areas where learnings can be identified and adopted. 
""These can then be shared with teams up and down the country so that we are all aligned in our response.""
According to the UK government website, the current terrorism threat level set by MI5 is ""substantial"" - meaning an attack is likely.

There are more than 200 fostering households in the city, but City of Wolverhampton Council said it was appealing to more people to become involved.
Its team will be at the Wulfrun Centre with an information stall on Monday, Wednesday and Friday next week from 10:00 to 16:30 GMT.
Councillor Jacqui Coogan, cabinet member for children, young people and education, said becoming a foster parent was a life-changing experience, both for parents and the children they care for.
""We're incredibly proud of the over 200 fostering households in our city, but there are still more children who need a safe and loving home,"" she said.
""If you have a spare room and love to give, we'd love to hear from you.""
Placements can be for a few days or a number of years, and foster parents receive a regular, tax exempt fee and allowance to cover the cost of bringing up the child, the city council said.
Online information sessions will also be held on Tuesday and Thursday from 18:30 to 19:30.
Coogan added: ""Our team, along with experienced foster parents, will be available at these events to answer your questions and share their experiences. We're here to guide and support you every step of the way.""

The clock, gifted by the nursing pioneer to Wellow Primary School in Romsey in 1877, has hung in the school ever since but has not worked for many years.
The school's executive headteacher, Mrs Beth Larcombe said: ""It's our claim to fame here at Wellow"".
With the school's 150th year looming, it applied to the programme to get the timepiece back up and ticking again.
Mrs Larcombe said it was ""nerve-racking... and also so exciting"" to hand the clock over to the team for its transformation.
""We're in a really special position in Wellow because we have all of the log books that go right back to when the school was first opened... they record daily life in the school,"" Mrs Larcombe said.
""In 1877 there is an entry that says that a clock, the gift of Miss F Nightingale, was hung,"" she added.
It has remained a cherished and admired feature on the wall of the school's library  and their biggest claim to fame.
The school was built in 1875 after Florence Nightingale's father gifted a piece of the land.
The historical timepiece was brought back into working order by the programme's clock restorer Steve Fletcher and clock face painter Cindy Welland.
Its story and restoration was broadcast on the Repair Shop on Wednesday 22 January on BBC1.

Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC that the US has no goods trade deficit with the UK, which occurs when a country imports more than it exports.
President Trump has doubled down on his threat to impose big tariffs on countries that sell products in the US.
""I think we've got an argument to engage with,"" Reynolds said.
The BBC asked whether the UK would be exempt from tariffs, given the absence of a trade deficit between the two nations. The president did not respond directly and instead spoke about the trading deficit the US and Canada have and his plans to rectify that. 
The prospect of higher taxes being introduced on imports to the US is concerning many world leaders because it will make it more expensive for companies to sell goods in the world's largest economy.
Trump told global executives at the World Economic Forum on this week that they could either produce their goods in the US or face widespread tariffs worth hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars.
But Reynolds said when it comes to manufactured goods, the US did not have a trade deficit with the UK. 
""We know this is something that not just President Trump, but the whole of his administration takes very seriously,"" he said.
""We've obviously got a services-based economy. The US does not have that deficit with us so if that's the logic of that position, I think we've got an argument to engage with.""
Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision. He sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue but he also uses them as leverage to pursue other policies.
He has already said he is considering imposing a 10% tax on imports from China as soon as 1 February, claiming the country is sending fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, to Mexico and Canada.  
Trump had also threatened 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, again citing fentanyl as well as immigration among his concerns. 
However, Trump has since said he ""would rather not"" impose tariffs, suggesting a trade deal could be on the table.
Separately, the business secretary said the UK had left open the possibility of following EU rules for food and farm products in order to return to frictionless access to European markets.
Reynolds said such an agreement - which lowers all trade barriers in return for mirroring EU rules and standards - would not cross the government's red lines.
The comments came after EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic told the BBC a new agreement, including so-called dynamic alignment on standards, is possible alongside other areas of pan-European co-operation on customs.
Reynolds said Sefcovic's tone was in keeping with what the government had already said about a ""twin-track strategy"" on trade. 
""We can improve the terms of trade with the EU in a way which doesn't revisit customs unions or single markets or the arguments of Brexit, and we can do that whilst pursuing closer trade links around the world,"" Reynolds said.
Labour fought last year's UK general election with a manifesto pledge to lower Brexit-related barriers and red tape for the export of food and farm products to the European Union.
The question has always been how deep such an agreement might be. It could be settled in the coming weeks, though firm decisions have not yet been made.
The Conservatives have voiced anger at reports of a potential new deal on UK-EU trade, with shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel telling MPs that the government was ""bending the knee to the EU"".
The Liberal Democrats have said the government is not doing enough to smooth trade with the EU.

NatWest said the number of customers using mobile apps also increased by 53% between 2019 and 2024.

179,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qwl2wqj4xo,2025-01-26,Restaurant blames looming tax hike for closure,"The owners of a restaurant in Kent have blamed tax increases introduced in October's budget for its closure.
The Pumproom in Chatham said it had been struggling because of rising costs and reduced consumer spending power.
Increased national insurance payments announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves have since made it impossible to cover their costs, the owners added.
The government said it was helping the hospitality industry by reducing duty on beer and making it easier for small businesses to claim tax relief.
The Pumproom was opened in 2020 as a fine dining restaurant and cocktail bar by the owners of the Copper Rivet Distillery in Chatham Maritime.
Matthew Russell of the distillery said: ""The restaurant would have to increase its turnover or its prices by roughly 15% to cover the additional wage costs.
""We're from Medway, we're born and bred and brought up in Medway, and really wanted to bring something special to this part of Kent.""
From April the rate employers pay national insurance will rise from 13.8% to 15%, while the threshold for paying it on each annual salary will fall from £9,100 to £5,000.
Morgan Schondelmer from the Beer and Pub Association said the hospitality sector will be hit by other changes on top of that.
""Right now pubs are getting 75% off their business rates bill... that is going down to 40%,"" she said.
""That's going to be a hit of several thousand pounds to the average pub.
""At the same time we're going to see increases in wages and increasing national insurance contributions.""
The government said the tax changes will generate £25bn for public services.
It said it is supporting pubs, bars and restaurants by cutting a penny off alcohol duty for every draught pint sold from February.
It also said it has doubled employment allowance, with some smaller businesses able to claim relief of up to £10,500 a year on their employer national insurance payments.

Sophie Power made the achievement - which is subject to official confirmation by Guinness World Records - at the National Running Show in Birmingham, beat the previous record of 211.49 miles (340 km).
She ran more than 226 miles (365km) in 48 hours, saying she is ""thrilled"" to have achieved the record and done it for a cause close to her heart - SheRaces, the charity she set up to champion female runners.
""It's been an incredible challenge and I'm very thankful it's over,"" she said.
Power said she had made it her mission to break down barriers facing women in sport - including greater consideration of women's needs in race planning.
She rose to prominence in 2018 when an image of her taken during the 2018 Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc captured her breastfeeding her son, during a 103-mile race, one of the world's toughest ultra-marathons, while a male competitor napped beside her.
This inspire her to set up the charity, which aims for better equity and inclusion for women in trail running and ultrarunning.
""SheRaces is about changing the narrative for women in endurance sports - breaking down barriers, creating opportunities, and empowering women to achieve their full potential,"" Power said.
""This record is proof that when given the platform, we can achieve the extraordinary.""
She added that running on a treadmill – as she did for this record – was harder than running outdoors, as the unchanging environment makes it mentally exhausting.
""You don't have the stimulation of scenery or fresh air to keep you going,"" she said.
""It was tough not being able to nap or properly eat while trying to keep moving, and the monotony tested my resilience, but ultimately we can do hard things and that's what I set out to prove.""
She said doing it for SheRaces and ensuring her daughter does not experience the barriers she faced kept her pushing on.

181,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93qd7kkq23o,2025-01-27,City footbridge plan secures a further £2m,"A city council has succeeded in securing a further £2m towards a footbridge project, to allow construction to begin later this year.
The additional funding brings the cost of the Cygnet Bridge in Peterborough, which will cross the River Nene and link Fletton Quays to the Embankment, to £8.3m.
It was approved by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority (CPCA), after the city council said the build would include complex design modifications and ""significantly higher"" costs of sewer diversions than initially projected.
Dr Nik Johnson, combined authority mayor, said he was ""proud and supportive"" of the project, which could be completed by summer 2026.
The project has drawn criticism from Peterborough residents, with some questioning the need for the bridge and its value for money, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
The council's transport and infrastructure committee discussed the latest progress on the bridge at a meeting in Huntingdon.
Councillor Angus Ellis, cabinet member for environment and transport at Peterborough City Council, said: ""It's key for active travel in the area for cyclists and pedestrians, otherwise they are walking on a very dangerous, small-ish pavement on a busy road.""
Councillor Sam Wakeford, vice chair of the transport and infrastructure committee, said: ""This isn't a controversial use of money, it looks great value and what construction projects aren't increasing in cost from previous projections?
""Obviously it's critical we manage funding as efficiently as we can but I think this is quite uncontroversial and will deliver significant benefits, so I'm pleased to support it.""
Peterborough City Council said it hoped the bridge would assist in creating a ""walkable, liveable city"" and reduce pressure on city centre traffic routes.
The government's Towns Fund pledged £2m towards the bridge, while the CPCA will now contribute £5.4m - and the remainder will be paid for by Peterborough City Council's redevelopment budget.

Charlie Norman, 19, studied art and design for his A-Levels at Abbeygate Sixth Form College in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.
For his final assignment, he explored medieval manuscripts and etchings and was able to explore St Edmundsbury Cathedral's collection for his research.
Mr Norman was awarded an A* in August, which he said had driven him to pursue a career in art.
""The chance to have my work exhibited has been incredibly exciting, and it's been a valuable insight into the process of organising an exhibition and collaborating with others,"" he said.
""Achieving an A* in art at sixth form was a huge milestone for me and it's really driven me to pursue a career in art. 
""It's given me the confidence to see that this is the right path, and the exhibition process has been such an eye-opener in terms of what my future could look like.""
For Mr Norman's final assignment, he was able to explore the cathedral's collection thanks to the help of the keeper of the library, Stephen Dart.
The student explained this offered him ""stylistic guidance"" for his project.
He then underwent 15 hours in exam conditions to create a pair of manuscript leaves on the sins of pride and gluttony.
They will now be exhibited in the Treasury at the cathedral in a new exhibition called Inspired in the Ancient Library.
Mr Norman's former teacher at Abbeygate Sixth Form, Louise Gridley, said it was ""wonderful"" his work was being showcased.
""He is such a diligent student and deserves this recognition - not only on account of his creative and technical realisation but for his historical scrutiny also,"" she added.
Sarah Friswell, the cathedral's visitor experience manager, added: ""We regularly exhibit books from our Ancient Library in the Cathedral Treasury. 
""On this occasion it is wonderful to showcase the work of a student who has created his own artwork from these inspirational books.""
Mr Norman has gone on to study an art foundation course at West Suffolk College. He aims to become a freelance artist after university.

Halton Council's planning department has approved the construction of a ""solar microgrid"" at the former St Michael's golf course in Widnes.
More than 7,200 solar panels will be installed, generating about four megawatts of electricity and powering public buildings including the council's headquarters, Lower House Lane depot, DCBL Stadium and the new leisure centre on Moor Lane.
The new 27-acre (11-hectare) complex, north of Ditton Road and south of Speke Road, will more than quadruple the capacity of an adjacent solar farm which opened in 2020.
The Local Democracy Service said the former municipal golf course was closed in 2004 on the advice of the Health Protection Agency.
This followed the discovery of arsenic in the ground and outbreaks of leachate (contaminated liquid) from waste mass. 
Plans to reopen the golf course to the public following clean-up work were announced in 2016 but did not come to fruition.

184,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3jlwnqnxxo,2025-01-24,Are Nimbys blocking major infrastructure plans?,"Major infrastructure projects in the East of England have been delayed by lengthy legal challenges, according to the government. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to end so-called Nimby - Not in My Back Yard - challenges from those he says stand in the way of the country's growth. But just how disruptive have these challenges been in the East of England, and why have groups campaigned against the projects cited by the government?
On Thursday, Sir Keir announced plans to block campaigners from making repeated legal challenges against decisions on major infrastructure projects in England and Wales.
His reasoning was to prevent ""cynical"" and ""hopeless"" appeals blocking plans for things such as wind farms, nuclear stations and transport projects.
As part of the announcement, Downing Street referenced Suffolk's Sizewell C nuclear power station, improvement plans for the A47 in Norfolk and wind farm infrastructure in the region that has been hit by campaigners' challenges.
Energy company EDF wants Sizewell C to provide what they claim would be decades of clean, reliable electricity, but it is waiting for a final investment decision, expected this year.
The government previously said new nuclear plants would be needed if the UK wanted to hit its target to decarbonise power generation, and some work has begun on the site in preparation.
In Norfolk, National Highways is undertaking three major upgrades to the A47.
The first scheme began last year on the section of the road between North Tuddenham and Easton, east of Norwich, which will create two additional lanes and two new junctions by 2027.
Finally, the LionLink and Sea Link offshore wind projects in Suffolk are due to see converter stations built at several locations in the county.
National Grid is waiting for permission from the government but has spoken of the wider project's importance.
Several groups have taken action against Sizewell C over a number of issues.
Most recently, Theberton and Eastbridge Action Group on Sizewell Limited lost a High Court bid to challenge the Office for Nuclear Regulation's decision to issue a licence for the site.
In December 2023, the Court of Appeal dismissed a legal challenge from Together Against Sizewell that argued the government failed to consider the need for a water supply at the site.
The A47 improvement schemes were previously thrown into doubt when a former Green Party councillor attempted to block them.
Andrew Boswell claimed the Department for Transport's development consent orders, approved in 2022, failed in each case to assess the significance of the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions, as required by law.
However, he lost his case at the High Court and then had a challenge dismissed at the Court of Appeal.
In May, the Supreme Court turned down his application for a legal challenge to be heard there.
National Highways said delays to the three schemes had caused costs to soar due to the impact of inflation.
Offshore4Sure has campaigned against the building of the substations in Suffolk.
It wants developers to find more appropriate sites, but National Grid said this would lead to a delay in greener energy and greater energy security.
It added that there were ""no suitable brownfield sites in east Suffolk"" for the substations.
Campaign group Stop Sizewell C has been vocal against the nuclear power station for a number of years.
Alison Downes, executive director of the group, said on Thursday that the prime minister's comments suggested people were ""always winning legal challenges"" – which was ""very far from being the case"".
She felt the decision could ""erode the right"" for people to defend where they live.
""Sometimes [legal challenges] are the only means left to address fundamental flaws in a project that have not been addressed either by the developers or by ministers,"" she said.
""It's people most affected by a project who are the ones who take the time and trouble to really read the detail and understand where all the difficulties are that quite often ministers and developers will try to gloss over, and which potentially could lead to very serious problems down the line.""
During a visit to the Port of Lowestoft on Thursday, Energy Security Secretary Ed Miliband told the BBC it was ""absolutely right"" for local people to be able to have a judicial review over what the government was doing.
However, he said there was often an ""endless cycle of case after case on the same issue"".
""I think we were elected to make a different choice as a country, which is [to] listen to local people [and] make sure that local communities get direct benefit if they host clean energy infrastructure, but also to build that infrastructure that is in the interest of the country,"" he added.
The government said it planned to use the upcoming Planning and Infrastructure Bill in March to introduce legislative changes to ""drive action at a strategic level"", providing certainty for developers and the environment.
It also promised to make 150 major infrastructure project decisions by the next election.

The supermarket says the move will ""simplify the business"", adding that most  Sainsbury's shoppers ""do not use the cafés regularly"".
Sainsbury's also plans to make a 20% reduction in senior management roles, saying the business faces a ""particularly challenging cost environment"".
Although Sainsbury's was already in the midst of a plan to save £1bn over the next few years, the BBC understands the rise in employer's National Insurance contributions set out in the Budget has also been a factor in the latest restructuring plan.
Rival Morrisons has also announced plans to axe 201office-based jobs.
A spokesperson for the supermarket said it was planning to ""remove the roles of Regional People Manager, Store People Manager and Case Specialist from our structure, meaning colleagues in these roles are being placed at risk of redundancy"".
In response to Sainsbury's announcement, Downing Street said: ""As we said at the Budget, difficult decisions were needed to restore economic stability, and put the public finances back on to a stable footing.""
Sainsbury's recently reported strong Christmas trading and said it expected annual profits to surpass £1bn.
But when he unveiled the trading figures earlier this month, chief executive Simon Roberts repeated his warning about the impact of measures announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and said there would be ""tough choices"".
Sainsbury's has said the rise in employer's NI contributions will cost it £140m from April.
The industry trade body, the British Retail Consortium, reckons higher costs for retailers will impact investment, jobs and lead to higher prices.
Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the cuts by Sainsbury's were ""devastating but no surprise"", adding that the government should ""undo its jobs tax"".
In the Budget, Reeves announced that the rate of National Insurance paid by employers would rise to 15% in April while the salary threshold at which payments begin would drop from £9,100 to £5,000.
The government expects the measure to raise £20bn.
Early last year, the previous Conservative government twice cut National Insurance payments made by workers, reducing the rate by 4% in total at a cost of billions of pounds.
This is the second wave of major job cuts for Sainsbury's in just over a year. Last February, it announced 1,500 roles would go. 
The supermarket group, which owns Argos and Habitat, will shut down its remaining 61 cafés and, as well as pizza and patisserie, will also dispense with its hot food counters.
Instead, it will make ""the most popular items available in the aisle"". 
Jobs will go from Sainsbury's head office as part of an update of its divisions and management ""to drive faster decision-making and bring costs down"".   
A fortnight ago, Sainsbury's said it would raise its average hourly pay by 5% to £12.60. But the wage increase will be introduced in two phases ""to help manage a particularly tough cost-inflation environment"".
The Unite union said the job cuts were ""a blatant example of profiteering on the backs of workers"".
Paul Travers, Unite's officer for food, said the supermarket should be ""ashamed"" for cutting jobs while making millions of pounds in profit.
But Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive at retail marketing firm Savvy, said Sainsbury's cuts are ""likely to be the first of many"" for the retail industry.
""As expected, services to shoppers will be cut as retailers wrestle with the increased costs of labour as a result of the Budget,"" Ms Shuttleworth said.
""But what's clear from Sainsbury's statement is that retail organisations will have to make difficult decisions at all levels of the organisation both in stores and behind the scenes in head office too.""

Danny Meigh, originally from Worcester, owns a house in Altadena and fled to San Diego with his partner and one-year-old baby when the fires started. 
The family returned to LA, however Mr Meigh said life remained far from normal. 
""It's hard and it's worrying, more fires are emerging everyday, people are wearing masks, it's like Covid again.""
On Wednesday, a new, fast-moving wildfire erupted in Los Angeles County, which prompted 31,000 people in the area to be placed under a mandatory evacuation order. 
Mr Meigh said there were air quality warnings in place which meant his son was unable to play outside. 
""He goes to daycare and he's not allowed to run around and play.
""I hate keeping him inside, he loves the outdoors.""
""We are thinking about going somewhere else to escape this and allow our kid to have a normal life"", he added. 
His vulnerable property in Altadena is let out to tenants and Mr Meigh lives with his family in an apartment about eight miles (12.8km) away. 
The tenants escaped safely from the house, but until recently a barricade blocked the roads towards the house and prevented anyone from returning. 
Mr Meigh said he planned to visit the house at the weekend, but to do so he would need to adhere to the safety requirements in place. 
""It's a mandatory order to wear a specific mask, goggles and hazmat suit"", he said. 
""It's making me question whether we want to stay here, because we can't see things getting better any time soon.""

The force urged drivers to ""be aware that some roads may be closed and be careful when driving of debris"".
South Western Railway ran trains at a reduced speed between Totton and Weymouth due to high wind speeds until 09:00.
The train firm said the forecast high winds meant services running across it whole network may be cancelled, delayed or revised. It said disruption was expected until 14:00.
The train firm has advised those travelling on routes west of Basingstoke on Friday to allow extra time to complete their journey and check their route before setting out.
Work at Southampton's container terminal also had to be stopped  from 02:00 until 08:00 after high winds at the terminal.

Amelia, from Chippenham, Wiltshire, was born nine weeks early in January 2021 but developed normally until her health deteriorated in the summer of 2022.
In 2023, she was featured in a national NHS campaign to highlight the number of children waiting for a transplant - currently around 290.
She finally received her transplant last spring and her mum Jodie said: ""Amelia is so much happier now and has so much more freedom.""
Amelia contracted sepsis and pneumonia before being listed for a transplant and was put on a Berlin heart - a machine which takes over some or all of the heart's functions.
This meant staying at Great Ormond Street Hospital from autumn 2022.
 ""We were waiting for 18 months at Great Ormond Street Hospital on the Berlin heart,"" Jodie told BBC Radio Wiltshire.
""We had a lot of ups and downs and kept dreaming about the day we got the call and went home to be a family of four.""
She said Amelia had been doing well since the transplant and the family celebrated her first Christmas at home last year.
""We enjoy the little things that everyone takes for granted like having a bath/shower, going to the park or just out for a walk, seeing family/friends and even going to nursery and so much more,"" she said.
""We have done so much since her transplant, we have gone on holiday, to the beach, swimming, parks, pumpkin picking, baking cakes, Amelia goes to nursery and we were very excited about Christmas.""
The family has an exciting year ahead, with Jodie expecting a baby boy in May and getting married to the children's father in August.
""As a family, we are forever grateful to Amelia's donor family for saying yes to organ donation and there's not enough words in the world to say thank you,"" she said.
""We just hope and pray more people say yes to organ donation, one person can save up to nine lives and a little bit of them will always live on.""
According to NHS data, in January around 290 children were on the waiting list for an organ transplant in the UK.

Last year, an extra 135,000 GP appointments were offered to patients across Walsall between January and November.
Out of the extras on offer, 75% were face-to-face, a small proportion were home visits and the rest were telephone appointments.
The figures were welcomed by councillors at a recent social care and health scrutiny meeting – but several shared personal experiences, and those of residents, that show patients are still encountering difficulties.
Councillor Waheed Rasab said one resident, an 87-year-old, said she had called the GP 31 times and couldn't get an appointment. ""That is the real problem,"" he added.
Meanwhile, councillor Amanda Parkes said she had found it difficult to get an appointment.
""If you don't go there and stand outside at 8am in the morning, you can't get an appointment, especially on a Monday,"" she said.
GP Dr Harinder Baggri told councillors he was shocked to hear about the problems people had faced.
""Looking at the actual patient data, the appointment levels have gone up,"" he said. ""However, since covid, the complexity of our patients has hugely increased.""
NHS Black Country Integrated Care Board (ICB), said it had hired 25 new members of staff to assist with the workload, seven of who were GPs.
Pip Mayo, representing the ICB, added that all NHS services were struggling with the level of funding they were receiving.
""We are seeing greater need coming through, more complexity and more people than we did pre-covid, and unfortunately the amount of funding hasn't kept pace with that,"" she said.
""I recognise there can be a disconnect between what we think we're doing strategically and what people are seeing on the ground.
""Getting feedback during the process is really important to help us understand how well things are landing and to move in the right direction with a really difficult funding situation.""

Six months of work is underway in North Walsham, Norfolk, to make improvements to the junction where Norwich Road meets the A149 bypass.
Berni Marfleet, of Save Our Streets North Walsham, said the official diversion was poorly signposted and had not been publicised.
Norfolk County Council said changes had been made following local feedback and the situation continued to be monitored.
The £750,000 project started on 6 January and will last six months.
Rather than following the planned diversion along Yarmouth Road, many drivers were using the smaller, pavement-less Aylsham Road.
Mr Marfleet, who has lived on Aylsham Road for 40 years, said: ""We recognise there's going to be improvements here, and where there is some gain there is often a little bit of pain.
""The diversions have just not been managed properly. We're getting rat-running on roads that just cannot cope with it. It is dangerous.""
He said he raised concerns with the council as soon as work began but securing changes had been ""a hard, uphill battle"".
Mr Marfleet said as well as improving signs on the official diversion route, police should be doing more to enforce the 20mph speed limit.
In a statement, Norfolk Police said: ""Our local beat manager is aware and monitoring the situation. However, this is an issue for the highways department at Norfolk County Council.""
The council said: ""Work currently under way in North Walsham was campaigned for by local residents and will provide much needed new safe crossing facilities connecting the skate park, the train station and the town centre. 
""Diversion signage has been improved following local feedback and we would like to encourage all motorists where possible to use the official diversion route, which is via the Bengate junction of Yarmouth Road to the south of the town.""

The image, obtained exclusively by BBC Verify, shows building work taking place at a location more than 600m inside what is known as the Area of Separation (AoS).
Under the terms of Israel's ceasefire agreement with Syria in 1974, the IDF is prohibited from crossing the so-called Alpha Line on the western edge of the AoS.
When contacted about the images, the IDF told the BBC its ""forces are operating in southern Syria, within the buffer zone and at strategic points, to protect the residents of northern Israel.""
The imagery captured on 21 January shows new structures and trucks at the cleared area.
Construction appears to have begun at the beginning of this year, with lower resolution imagery showing gradual development at the site since 1 January.
A new track or road measuring around 1km also appears to join with a pre-existing road that leads into Israeli territory.
Drone photographs shared by a Syrian journalist on 20 January shows trucks, excavators and bulldozers at the site.
Jeremy Binnie, Middle East specialist at defence intelligence company Janes, told us: ""The photo shows what appear to be four prefabricated guard posts that they will presumably crane into position in the corners, so this is somewhere they are planning to maintain at least an interim presence"".
The BBC has previously filmed military forces near the town of Majdal Shams, which is within the buffer zone and around 5.5km from the new construction.
In November, satellite imagery also showed the IDF building a trench following the Alpha Line on the western side of the buffer zone, stretching past Jubata al-Khashab.
Following the fall of the Syrian regime last month, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered his forces to enter the AoS, saying: ""We will not allow any hostile force to establish itself on our border.""
The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) has previously said that Israeli construction along the AoS with Syria amounts to ""severe violations"" of the ceasefire agreement.

He added: ""This unit has been used for a pop-up market previously and is in a great location for traders.""
The renovation of Freshney Place, which will include a new food hall and market alongside a five-screen cinema, is due to begin next month.
Top Town Market has been on Bull Ring Lane since 1976. The new permanent market is due to be completed in spring 2027.
The council said it had offered a ""full support package"" to market traders ""to help them to transition"".
However, not all the traders had chosen to move to the temporary space, while cafes based at Top Town would be unable to use it because of their specific requirements. 
A spokesperson said: ""The next step is to work with those traders who have committed to relocation to ensure a smooth transition into the temporary space.
""The council is talking separately with the cafes about other suitable spaces in the town centre, which can better accommodate their needs.""

In May 2024, Terrence Moore, director of the Cat Survival Trust in Welwyn, Hertfordshire, was found guilty of four charges of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.
Dartmoor Zoo said the cat, called Churchill, would remain in an off-show enclosure for a 30-day quarantine, giving him time to adjust to his new environment.
The zoo's CEO David Gibson said he was ""delighted"" to be able to offer a new home to the serval cat.
Dartmoor Zoo has been working with Hertfordshire Zoo and The Big Cat Sanctuary - which is currently housing 28 rescued cats - whilst attempting to find them new homes.
Dartmoor Zoo's CEO David Gibson said he could not praise the management and staff at Hertfordshire Zoo and the Big Cat Sanctuary enough ""for the commitment they have shown in stepping in and ensuring the welfare of the cats affected was prioritised"".
He added: ""We are delighted to be able to offer a new home for one of the animals and Churchill the male serval will be a great addition to our collection.
""Once he has completed his quarantine he will be placed into an outdoor enclosure where he will have plenty of space to display all his natural behaviours.""
Mr Gibson said: ""Churchill has very obviously had a very difficult life to date, and we are going to be working very hard to make sure that the rest of his natural life is rich, rewarding and stimulating.""
The zoo said he would be joined by a female serval named Sabra in the outdoor enclosure.

Mark Brindley spoke to BBC Politics Midlands after the death this week of 12-year-old Leo Ross in a stabbing in Hall Green, Birmingham.
Mr Brindley, whose son James died in Aldridge in 2017, said Leo's death was ""utterly shocking and tragic"".
""My heart goes out to that little boy who's lost his life and his family and friends and the community,"" he said.
""We know exactly first hand what they're going through, it's terrible.
""The ripples just carry on through the rest of our lives, literally to the end of our days. We live with it, every day.
""But there is hope, I firmly believe that.""
The West Midlands Police area recorded the highest rate of knife crime offences in England and Wales for the whole of 2023, according to official figures
Offences involving a blade per 100,000 of the population, in the force area in 2023, totalled 180, up from 167 in 2022. The London Metropolitan Police force total was 165.
Mr Brindley claimed educational programmes were proven to turn young people away from anti-social behaviour. 
After his son's death, Mr Brindley set up The James Brindley Foundation, to address youth violence.
He said their educational programme had shown young people could be directed away from anti-social behaviour, once the motivations behind the behaviour were understood.
""We know that works because it's predictable and therefore preventable,"" he said.
""All the issues of getting knives of the street is really important but it should start with education as early as possible so young people don't fall into these anti-social habits and offending.""
Mr Brindley said he wanted to see an anti-knife crime educational programme added to the national curriculum.
Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill and Conservative MP Saqib Bhatti discussed on the programme how they believed knife crime should be tackled in the West Midlands.
Both agreed more stop and searches should be carried out by the police.
Mr Bhatti, the MP for Meriden and Solihull East, said: ""We can't have sensitivities around this. I think stop and search is a very valuable tool for the police and I certainly hope they're using that.""
Ms Gill, the MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said the government wanted to employ more police officers to enable more stop and searches.
However, she added that this was only part of the solution, stressing the importance of intervention and youth services.
""Young people want somewhere to go which is safe, somewhere where they can have some hope of breaking the cycle, of not being exploited by criminal gangs,"" she said.
""We've got to take strict measures, we cannot keep having young people taking each other's lives. They've got to have hope, opportunity.""

Hull City Council said the goods would not have been subject to any safety checks, including measures which would prevent them easily igniting when not actively being smoked.

Paul Givan met with the Education Authority (EA) on Saturday to discuss the damage caused by Storm Éowyn to schools across Northern Ireland.
More than 100 schools have reported issues ranging from minor damage to fences and missing roof tiles to more significant structural damage.
Givan told BBC News NI that about 10 schools will be unable to open for in-person learning on Monday. 
EA's School Transport Service plans to operate as normal; however, there may be some disruption or delays to routes as a result of damage to roads.
The EA is coordinating the emergency response and providing assistance to schools that have been impacted by the storm.
""Staff are out on the ground assessing the damage to schools, taking forward essential repairs, and establishing whether it is safe for the more severely damaged schools to open on Monday,"" Givan said.
The department has estimated that more than 100 schools are still without power.
""While every effort continues to be made over this weekend to ensure that impacted schools can reopen as soon as practicably possible, it is likely that some schools may need to move to remote learning on Monday 27 January 2025.""
Givan added that if a decision has been taken to close a school building, principals should provide learning from home.
Schools will be communicating any special arrangements or closures directly with parents.

PC Morgan Younger was at a petrol station in Lee High Road in Lewisham, south-east London, when the incident unfolded at about 15:00 GMT on Saturday.
The ""quick-thinking"" officer, who was on duty at the time, took the suspect to the ground and disarmed and restrained him while calling for further assistance.
A man in his 60s was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of an offensive weapon and remains in custody, the Met said.
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jon Savell said: ""This is outstanding work from an officer who was on patrol alone, saw a very violent crime in progress and, without hesitation, raced in to assist.
""I cannot overstate how proud we are in the Met today of his quick-thinking and bravery. He was calm and professional and everything we want our police officers to be.
""I have no doubt without his intervention, the victim would have been seriously injured.""
PC Younger, who is attached to South East Command Unit, was on patrol when he stopped at the petrol station to quickly buy a drink. 
At the entrance, he saw a man grab the victim around the throat and try to stab him with a large knife, the Met said.
The officer took hold of the suspect and struggled with him while he continued to wield the knife, before disarming him.
He kept the man under control for five minutes until further officers arrived to help.
The victim, aged in his 40s, was not injured.
The suspect was further arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods and being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs, after a quantity of drugs was found at his home address, the Met added.

The ""living histories"" of the fishing community of Hastings, East Sussex, at the town's Hastings Contemporary gallery are being collected to display.  
The project is part of a season of events that celebrate the ""unique knowledge, skills and practices of the Hastings fishing fleet"".
A gallery spokesperson said it will ""preserve an intangible cultural heritage for future generations"".
The exhibition is part of a year-long project to create an online archive of oral histories, an illustrated map of the historic Stade area, and a programme of community events and engagement activities.
The scheme has received a grant of almost £250,000 from The National Lottery Heritage Fund. 
Artist Mary Hooper is creating an oral history archive by means of an immersive sound installation, The Sun Feeds the Wind, which will be at the gallery from 29 March for six months.  
The Hastings fishing fleet consists of about 25 boats. 
It is one of the oldest remaining beach-launched fishing fleets in Europe.
Paul Joy, chairperson of Hastings Fishermen's Protection Society, said: ""As custodians of the sea, we connect our town to its history, with traditions which pre-date 1066.
""And to its future - offering answers to the challenges facing our oceans and coastal communities.

Dozens of companies have pulled their advertisements from the network, which was criticised for trying to cover up the scandal.
Masahiro Nakai was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a 2023 dinner party allegedly organised by Fuji TV staff. He announced his retirement from show business last week.
The Japanese government has called on Fuji TV to regain trust from viewers and sponsors.
In a press conference on Monday, Fuji TV chairman Shuji Kano and president Koichi Minato bowed as they announced their resignations. It came shortly after an emergency board meeting.
They apologised to viewers as well as stakeholders for the trouble and anxiety caused in a scandal that has rocked Japan's entertainment industry.
""I feel deeply the weight of my responsibility for undermining trust in the media,"" said Mr Minato. ""Looking back, I realise there were shortcomings in our response.""
Mr Minato had admitted previously that the company had known about the allegation against Nakai shortly after the alleged incident took place. But Fuji TV chose not to disclose it at the time, as it ""prioritised the woman's physical and mental recovery as well as the protection of her privacy"", he had said.
Reports emerged last month that Nakai had paid the unnamed woman more than half a million dollars. More allegations then surfaced that a Fuji TV employee had helped to arrange the dinner party.
Nakai, a former member of boy band SMAP and a household name who fronted several Fuji TV shows,  has denied using violence against the woman. He has also said that he had ""resolved"" the matter with her through a settlement.
But this did little to quell public anger.
Car manufacturers Nissan and Toyota were among the companies that pulled advertising from Fuji TV.
In an open letter, investment firm Rising Sun Management which is the majority shareholder of Fuji TV's parent company, said that the scandal ""exposes serious flaws in your corporate governance"".
Fuji TV has since set up an independent committee to investigate the scandal.
Executive vice president Kenji Shimizu, who will replace Mr Minato as president, said he would ""never tolerate acts that violate human rights"" and committed to preventing similar incidents by ""starting from scratch"".
Earlier this month, the network suspended a weekly show hosted by Nakai while other major networks have also dropped the presenter.
Other TV networks have also announced their own investigations, following reports that similar dinner parties involving celebrities are a common practice in the industry.

The trial is looking at how a specialised device can help strengthen hand and arm function, using a small earpiece to stimulate the vagus nerve.
Called transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (TVNS), it forms part of rehabilitation therapy, and involves sending mild electrical pulses to the brain.
Patients will be asked to wear it while they move their weak arm.
The stimulation is automatically activated as the arm is moved during therapy and the connected earpiece gently tickles the ear.
This can be done at home and does not involve invasive surgery.
A stroke occurs when blood stops flowing to a part of your brain, it can affect things like speech and movement – and can take a long time to recover.
Led by researchers in Sheffield, the £2m trial is being run in 19 centres around the country, including from locations in Bournemouth, Sherborne and Dorchester.
Patients have already been enrolled via two local NHS trusts - UHD and Dorset HealthCare - but researchers need more people to come forward.
Ian Odd, 76, who lives in Dorset, had a stroke in 2020 and is taking part in the trial.
He said he was ""very tired"" after his stroke.
""Even doing simple hand exercises was very, very difficult,"" he said.
""There's so many frustrating things that you need two hands for - simple little things, like doing a zip up.""
He said he jumped at the opportunity to be involved in the trial.
""Anything that can help me, four years down the line, I will be more than happy to try it, because I wasn't improving with the exercises I was doing,"" he said.
""This trial gives people some hope that you can get back some, if not all, the functions that you had before.""
Known as the TRICEPS trial, it will run for two years.
Dr Louise Johnson, consultant therapist in stroke rehabilitation at University Hospitals Dorset, said: ""This is potentially quite a ground-breaking trial for upper limb recovery after stroke.
""So, if the trial demonstrates that vagal nerve stimulation enhances the benefits of rehabilitation, then we can look at rolling out this intervention on the NHS to help people's recovery.""

A man, 25, was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder on Wednesday.
In a tribute to her friend, Ms Rix told the BBC Ms Cleary was ""the best friend anyone could ask for, she was kind and loving, loyal to fault"".
She said: ""Dianne could change the vibe in a room with her glowing smile and infectious laugh, Dianne had a resilience like nobody I've known, finding the positives in the worst of situations. 
""Dianne didn't know how beautiful she really was, which only added to her charm… she had the twinkling blue eyes, cheekbones and the dimples, a feature she passed down to her beautiful children.

Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service personnel, Leicestershire Police officers and a Leicester City Council traffic warden took part in a joint operation to tackle problem parking on Wednesday.
Cars left on corners or over double yellow lines are hindering emergency services in the area, said the brigade.
Police patrols were also completed at Mayflower Primary, Catherine Infant and Junior, Mellor Community Primary, Abbey Mead Primary and Rushey Mead Academy schools.
Fixed penalty notices and penalty charge notices were issued by police and the council, said officers, while an illegal tint on a vehicle was removed and a fly-tip was reported.
Objects on the road to reserve parking spaces were also removed and warning notices issued by the fire service.
The action, which included members of Leicestershire Fire and Rescue's Eastern station's Blue Watch, was part of the ongoing Operation Syphon, which aims to tackle road safety issues in the east of the city.
The road safety initiative has been carrying out enforcement since December, led by police officers based in East Leicester, as Sgt Chris Hall said residents had raised ""concerns"" about road safety.
A spokesperson for Eastern Fire Station said: ""Narrow streets already make it challenging for our fire engines to manoeuvre, but when cars are parked on corners or double yellow lines, responding to emergencies becomes even harder.
""By getting out into the community, we're highlighting just how important it is to park considerately.
""Next time you park, ask yourself: Could a fire engine get through? Your choices could make all the difference in an emergency.""

The event is to be held in Rugby town centre on Sunday to mark the start of the lunar calendar in the year of the snake. 
The day will involve a number of events including a procession of dancing lions, dragons, lanterns and drums.
Organiser Amy Zhang said the event will be held for the first time as the number of Chinese families in the areas, attracted by local schools, is growing. 
The event will take place in Market Place between 11:00 and 16:00 GMT, said Mrs Zhang, who is also chair of the Warwickshire Chinese society.
""Over the last three or fours years there's been lots of young families moving to Rugby,"" Mrs Zhang continued. 
""We've had a lot of people from Hong Kong as well. The main reason is the school - it's growing all the time.
""The Chinese New Year celebrations are a very important annual celebration for the Chinese Community and I am really pleased that we have the opportunity to celebrate it with the wider community in the town centre.""
Linda Lowne, Rugby's first business director, said the Chinese community continues to grow.
""We are looking forward to welcoming visitors from Coventry, Warwick and Leamington, many of whom are university students, to the town centre which can only be good news for the local economy,"" she said.

212,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crlkjejpwr8o,2025-01-23,'A mockery': Trump's new meme-coin sparks anger in crypto world,"US President Donald Trump has been criticised for launching a meme-coin while saying he ""doesn't know much"" about the cryptocurrency.
The digital coin called TRUMP appeared on his social media accounts ahead of his inauguration on Monday and quickly became one of the most valuable crypto coins. The value of a single coin shot up to $75 within a day, but since has fallen to $39.
But the launch of the so-called meme-coin - a cryptocurrency with no utility other than for fun or speculation - has been widely criticised by industry insiders.
""Trump's comments about not knowing much about the coin back up my opinion that he is making a mockery of the industry. It's a stunt,"" says Danny Scott, CEO of CoinCorner. 
The latest dip in value came after Trump told reporters: ""I don't know much about it other than I launched it, other than it was very successful."" 
When he was told his coin raised several billion dollars for him, he played it down saying ""several billion - that's peanuts for these guys"" pointing to tech billionaires assembled for a press conference about AI.
Meme-coins are often used by speculators to make money or to allow fans to show support to a celebrity or moment in internet culture.
It's not the first time Trump has sold crypto products. He made millions from launching a series of NFTs of him in various superhero poses in 2022.
Some industry analysts say the president having his own meme coin is a sign that others should follow.
""TRUMP token just signaled to every company, municipality, university & individual brand that crypto can now be used as a capital formation and customer bootstrapping mechanism,"" Jeff Dorman from investing firm Arca posted online.
However, the overall sentiment seems to be negative towards the president's meme coin.
Many in the crypto world are waiting for Trump to back up campaign promises to help boost the industry in the US. People like Danny Scott hope to see focused plans, particularly around Bitcoin, from the administration.
On Thursday the president took a first step towards fulfilling those promises by signing an Executive Order to set up a working group to explore changes to crypto regulation and potentially create a national crypto stockpile.
Last year Trump promised Bitcoin fans he would make the US the ""crypto capital of the planet"". A few days into his term, the president has not issued executive orders involving cryptocurrency, nor has he mentioned it in his speeches.
TRUMP coin is now the 25th most valuable crypto coin with a value of around $8 billion, according to the website CoinMarketCap.
Trump and the team behind it own 80% of the coins so, in theory, they would make billions of dollars if they sold their shares and the price remained the same.
This set-up has been described by crypto researchers at K33 as outdated for similar tokens. 
""There's no sugar-coating this - these tokenomics are horrendous for a meme-coin,"" said David Zimmerman, a K33 analyst.
However, K33 analysts acknowledge that the remaining 80% of coins can't be dumped on the open market so investors are partially shielded from price shocks.
There are thousands of cryptocurrency coins and anyone can create one.
First Lady Melania Trump launched her own meme-coin on the eve of the inauguration, which now has a value of $700m since slumping from $13 a coin to $2.70.
But many meme-coins have led to big losses for people investing in them.
Dan Hughes, from crypto firm Radix, thinks the president and his wife launching their meme-coins undermines the positives of the industry.
""This pattern of celebrity-driven token launches, particularly from political figures, potentially marks a concerning trend in crypto markets where influence and liquidity manipulation could overshadow fundamental value creation,"" he said.
Others in the cryptocurrency world think that launching meme-coins to make money is degrading.
""The introduction of these coins during the presidential inauguration raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and may undermine the dignity of the president and the first lady,"" said Grzegorz Drozdz, market analyst at investment firm Conotoxia.

Shehnaz Ossman, 52, from Dundee, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) - a type of blood cancer - in July 2024.
She is in remission but continues to receive chemotherapy and needs a transplant due to the aggressive nature of her cancer.
Her daughters Ruqueia and Aisha said no family members in Scotland were a stem cell match, so they were moving their search to Leicester where their extended family lived.
The donor drive - at Judgemeadow Community College between 10:00 and 16:00 GMT on Saturday - will be open to the general public.
Ruqueia said she hoped the event would find a donor for her mother or, at least, help another family in a similar situation.
""It really is giving someone a second chance at life,"" the 31-year-old said.
""My cousins, aunts and uncles are in Leicester, all of them love Leicester, and for many of them my mum is like a mum to them.""
According to Cancer Research UK, AML starts from young white blood cells in the bone marrow.
In a transplant, the new stem cells make their way to the bone marrow before making the blood cells required to support recovery.
Donor charity DKMS is helping the family organise the event and will run it on the day.
Dr Tasneem Ali, from the charity, said anyone could be a match for Shehnaz, but those with the same ethnicity were more likely to be a suitable donor.
She added: ""It's just a few hours of your time and donating a bit of blood, you can potentially save somebody's life.""

Richard Leighfield, 53, was arrested in August when, purporting to be a 13-year-old girl, he instigated sexual conversations via an online profile he presumed to be that of a child, but was really a means for authorities to intercept predatory behaviour.
He pleaded guilty to six offences in December, including attempting to engage a child in sexual activity.
At Worcester Crown Court on Thursday, Leighfield, who previously taught in the city, was jailed for 30 months.
Among other offences to which he pleaded guilty were three counts of making indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of a child, and one count of possessing a prohibited image of a child.
One of those images was classified as category A - the most severe. Eight were category B and 10 were category C.
He also pleaded guilty to attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child.
Det Con Giuseppe Saladino from the force said: ""Leighfield demonstrated predatory behaviour towards children and was responsible for making horrific images.
""Fortunately his behaviour was intercepted by an online child profile, but this in no way lessens the seriousness of his offences.""
A spokesperson for Northwick Manor Primary School, where Leighfield used to teach, said: ""While no pupils at our school were involved in this matter, we have treated it incredibly seriously and have provided support to our school community, as appropriate.""
Leighfield has been placed on the sex offenders register for life.

215,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjvqe4n7gzo,2025-01-24,New Nigerian jihadist group declared terrorists,"Nigeria's authorities have officially declared the Lakurawa armed group - which  flogs people for listening to music - a terrorist organisation and banned it across the country.
Lakurawa is a new militant group which carries out attacks, targeting local communities in north-western Nigeria and across the border with Niger.
Nigerian officials say Lakurawa is affiliated with jihadist factions in Mali and Niger, and its militants have for years settled in communities along the Nigeria-Niger border, marrying local women and recruiting youths.
This adds to Nigeria's security concerns, as it is already fighting against several armed groups, from Islamist militants Boko Haram to kidnapping gangs.
The Nigerian government submitted a document to a High Court in the capital, Abuja, on Thursday, detailing the activities of the group. 
It said Lakurawa had been involved in acts of terrorism, including cattle rustling, kidnapping for ransom, hostage-taking and attacks on top government officials. 
The group was also accused of spreading harmful ideology within local communities and encouraging locals to disregard authorities, ""resulting in injuries, and loss of lives and property to innocent citizens of Nigeria"".
The group emerged few years ago in some villages in Sokoto and Kebbi states and people had notified authorities of its existence but nothing was done.
At first, Lakurawa members promised to tackle banditry and help protect local people from cattle thieves. 
""But things escalated when they started asking to check people’s phones and would flog those that have music in them before deleting them,"" one Sokoto resident told the BBC last year.
In the court papers, Nigeria's Attorney-General and Minister of Justice Lateef Fagbemi said the group's activities posed a serious threat to national security.
Last year, military spokesperson Maj Gen Edward Buba said the emergence of Lakurawa was directly linked to political instability in neighbouring Mali and Niger. 
The military has seized power in both countries, partly because of the pressure of an Islamist insurgency.
In a swift decision, Justice James Omotosho declared the group ""a terrorist organisation and extended the ban to similar groups across Nigeria, with a specific focus on the North West and North Central regions"".
This move will give the Nigerian government sweeping powers to take strong actions against the group. 
Security agencies now have broad mandates to disrupt and dismantle the group's operations, including arrests, prosecution, asset freezes, and increased surveillance.
It could also lead to public stigma and isolation for individuals associated with the designated group.
Across the country, especially in northern Nigeria, people fear another scenario similar to when Boko Haram emerged in the late 2000s.
Boko Haram means ""Western education is forbidden"", and it has repeatedly targeted secular schools as part of its attempts to establish its version of Islamic rule in the region.
The group gained notoriety internationally when it kidnapped more than 200 school girls from the north-eastern town of Chibok in 2014.

217,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxevpzy3yko,2025-01-23,LinkedIn accused of using private messages to train AI,"A US lawsuit filed on behalf of LinkedIn Premium users accuses the social media platform of sharing their private messages with other companies to train artificial intelligence (AI) models.
It alleges that in August last year, the world's largest professional social networking website ""quietly"" introduced a privacy setting, automatically opting users in to a programme that allowed third parties to use their personal data to train AI.
It also accuses the Microsoft-owned company of concealing its actions a month later by changing its privacy policy to say user information could be disclosed for AI training purposes. 
A LinkedIn spokesperson told BBC News that ""these are false claims with no merit"". 
The filing also said LinkedIn changed its 'frequently asked questions' section to say that users could choose not to share data for AI purposes but that doing so would not affect training that had already taken place.
""LinkedIn's actions... indicate a pattern of attempting to cover its tracks,"" the lawsuit said.
""This behaviour suggests that LinkedIn was fully aware that it had violated its contractual promises and privacy standards and aimed to minimise public scrutiny"".
The lawsuit was filed in a California federal court on behalf of a LinkedIn Premium user and ""all others"" in a similar situation.
It seeks $1,000 (£812) per user for alleged violations of the US federal Stored Communications Act as well as an unspecified amount for breach of contract and California's unfair competition law.
According to an email LinkedIn sent to its users last year, it has not enabled user data sharing for AI purposes in the UK, the European Economic Area and Switzerland. 
LinkedIn has more than one billion users around the world, with almost a quarter of them in the US.
In 2023, the company attracted $1.7bn in revenue from premium subscriptions. 
It has also said that the number of premium subscribers has been growing rapidly as it continues to add more AI features.

The remains of the young female Rottweiler-German Shepherd cross were discovered in undergrowth in Wilton Lane, Guisborough.
It was reported to the RSPCA which sent its chief inspector, Mark Gent, to collect the animal.
Ch Insp Gent described finding the dog as ""really upsetting"" and has appealed to the public for information about what happened.
""We're very keen to be able to progress this investigation and find out how and why this poor dog came to be found in circumstances like this,"" he said.
The black-and-tan dog was extremely thin and because the animal was badly decomposed, the RSPCA said it could not establish a cause of death.
A microchip was found on the dog, which was registered to a woman who said it was one of 13 puppies she had bred and sold two years ago.
The breeder had given all the puppies different coloured collars and believed it had been called Blue.
However, she was unable to provide the animal charity with details about the person who had bought Blue.
The RSPCA is appealing to anyone with information about the dog's death or who recognises the suitcase to come forward.

220,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj65ryjylxdo,2025-01-23,Council spends thousands in tree-felling battle,"Thousands of pounds have been spent by a council as it battles protesters over the felling of a 120-year-old tree, a town mayor said.
Wivenhoe Town Council, in Essex, must axe the Old King George oak after reports showed it was causing subsidence at nearby homes.
Campaigners delayed the felling last week after barricading the tree with their cars and setting up an encampment.
Mayor Denise Burke said the council was in a race against time to chop the oak down before it became liable for damage on 1 February.
The deadline was set by insurer Aviva after residents living in the affected properties complained about the damage.
Aviva held negotiations with the council for four years, but said action must be taken after three reports concluded the tree was the root cause of the problem.
The work has been subsequently delayed as a result of protests at the site.
Burke alleged progress also stalled when a tree surgeon was ""intimidated and harassed"" out of doing the work.
""Protesters were gunning for him and you can't blame him for wanting to walk away,"" claimed Burke.
The mayor said vehicles illegally parked near the tree for more than a week were removed on Wednesday.
However, a small encampment of people has remained at the site.
""The next step is to have the protesters removed from the site because that still holds us back,"" Burke added.
""While we have responsibility to remove the tree, we will do everything in our power to meet that responsibility.""
Police were called to a peaceful protest on 13 January as contractors attempted to install fencing at the site.
The combined costs of security, fencing and legal representation was seeing the council's bill ""ramping up into the thousands"","" Burke explained.
She added: ""Businesses are also now feeling the pinch because customers are saying they have nowhere to park.""
Campaigners insist their efforts have been peaceful and focused on saving the tree.
They said they believed there could be other reasons why the homes in Clifton Terrace were being damaged, including the effects of a nearby railway line.
Legal representatives from both the council and protesters are due to meet on Friday in a bid to resolve the issue.
""I have hope that we can still find a solution but the clock is ticking,"" said 31-year-old protester, Kat Scott.
""It's caused real upset in the community and I think it's going to do a lot of long-term damage for the council.""
An Aviva spokeswoman said it was ""working hard to provide a solution"".

Former chair of the Friends of Kirkby Fleetham Church of England Primary School, Fran Hilyer, made the remarks after the Dales Academies Trust revealed proposals to shut the school near Bedale, North Yorkshire, after the summer term.
Low pupil numbers and their impact on children's wellbeing and its long-term financial sustainability were given as the reasons for the decision.
Chief executive of the Trust, Damian Chubb, promised to ""work closely with the families affected to ensure their children are well-placed into a new school."" 
It is understood local governors of the school were only notified about the potential closure last week, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
A source close to the school said a number of parents were ""reeling from the news and questioning how on earth the trust can propose to close the school without any consultation"".
Mr Chubb said the trust was awaiting further details from the Department for Education after an ""in-principle agreement"" to the closure from the Secretary of State.
He also said that the trust, which runs 15 other schools - mainly in North Yorkshire - had completed its own review process. 
""It is our duty to uphold an exceptional provision for learning and wellbeing, which simply cannot be achieved under the circumstances,"" he added.

Adrian Lee - also known as Adrian Tiene - met the woman in 2022 and quickly moved into her house, according to Leicestershire Police.
He told her who she could meet, began verbally abusing her, taking drugs and then attacking her.
Lee was convicted of multiple offences after a trial and on Wednesday, he was jailed for a total of 22 years.
After moving his belongings into the woman's home, Lee started to tell her she could not see her friends, police said.
The 29-year-old also demanded to know who she was messaging, subjected her to verbal and racial abuse and then raped her.
Over the following days, officers said, he took cannabis and cocaine, told her what to cook, forced her to stay in the same room as him and demanded he drove on a trip despite not being qualified.
He then became physically violent and the woman ran to a friend's house and the police were called.
Lee, of HMP Lincoln, was arrested, interviewed and charged. 
In September, following a trial at Leicester Crown Court, Lee was found guilty of three counts of raping a woman aged 16 or over, one count of assaulting a female 13 or over by penetration with part of a body/a thing, one count of sexual assault on a female and one count of engaging in controlling/coercive behaviour in an intimate/family relationship.
He will also be subject to a sexual harm prevention order, a restraining order and will sign the sex offenders register.

The Guernsey Farmers Association (GFA) welcomed the proposal to increase land payments from about £1m to £2.35m by 2026, but said it was £300,000 below the 2014 subsidy if it had risen in line with inflation.
GFA president Michael Bray said the increase would go some way to ""right a wrong"" but lower milk sales as well as higher fuel, feed and fertiliser costs meant farmers were ""suffering"".
Deputy Lindsay de Sausmarez, Environment and Infrastructure President, said if passed the rise would help the sector ""back on a more stable footing"".
The association, which represents the island's 11 dairy farms, said payments decreased from about £2m in 2014 to their current level by 2019.
It said this followed the States switch to a consumer-pays model, which had seen the cost of a carton of milk steadily rise.
Mr Bray said the current situation ""clearly [could] not continue without a collapse of the island's dairy"".
He argued the rising cost of milk had also contributed to a ""significant drop in retail sales"".
He said the price of milk had increased by more than 35p a litre in recent years, while the island's farms now produced 700,000 fewer litres of milk a year.
Mr Bray said if farmers were to get the increased subsidy his organisation was calling for he expected milk prices to ""stabilise"", reducing the need for further price rises for consumers.
However, he said it was unlikely the price of milk would fall.

Nottinghamshire Police said it happened inside the City Ground after Forest's 1-0 victory over Ipswich Town at about 17:00 GMT on 30 November.
According to a statement issued on Thursday, witnesses reported seeing an away fan aim abuse at a disabled supporter sitting behind him in the Bridgford Stand.
The force said the individual started banging on the glass that separated them in a bid to try and antagonise the fan, while also appearing to mock his disability.
Police say officers are treating it as a hate crime incident, and have released an image of someone officers would like to speak to as part of the investigation.
The force has shared the appeal with police in Suffolk.
PC Rose Barton said: ""While we appreciate this individual is not likely to be local due to him being sat in the away end, we'd encourage anyone who recognises him from this appeal to come forward.
""Likewise, we'd urge the man in question to do the right thing and make himself known to us, as we'd like to ask him a few questions and believe he could assist our inquiries.
""There is absolutely no place for hate in any of its forms in our communities – whether that's inside a football stadium or out on the streets.""

The airport submitted a development consent order in 2023 to bring its northern runway, normally a taxiway, into regular use for routine flights. A final decision is expected by 27 February.
Five MPs from Sussex, Surrey and Kent have asked transport secretary Heidi Alexander to delay that decision until the ""true impact of noise"" that the airport currently makes is understood.
A spokesperson for Gatwick said the airport has  a ""network of state-of-the-art noise monitors"" which provide ""comprehensive coverage"".
Mike Martin and Tom Tugendhat, MPs for Tunbridge Wells and Tonbridge respectively, have signed the letter, alongside Dorking and Horley's MP Chris Coghlan. 
Mid Sussex MP Alison Bennett and Horsham's John Milne have also added their names.
They claim that an ""informed decision"" on the Northern Runway Project cannot be made until adequate monitoring is put in place. 
""In most of our constituencies there is only one active noise monitor and in some there is no noise monitoring at all,"" the letter reads.
""The little monitoring which is taking place paints a worrying picture."" 
The airport has outlined a noise reduction scheme for local residents as part of expansion plans it claims would double capacity to 78 million passengers.
A spokesperson for Gatwick said: ""The London Gatwick noise footprint has reduced by around 40% in the last 20 years.
""We have a network of state-of-the-art noise monitors located in a large area surrounding the airport to ensure comprehensive coverage.""
Local communities, councils, and environment groups are involved with the noise monitoring process, the airport says.
A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said all expansion proposals must be ""compatible with environmental commitments, and strict standards on air quality and noise pollution"".

Weir Minerals Europe Limited on Halifax Road, Todmorden, which employs about 350 people, could close by the end of 2025 under the plan.
Employees in unaffected roles would transfer to a new engineering and technology centre which is set to open nearby, according to Weir.
The specialist mining equipment producer is planning to relocate production to other foundries, including Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg in South Africa.
The firm said the aim of the proposal was to ""bringing the business closer to its key customers"".
Key markets for mining commodities like copper are in central Asia, the Middle East and Africa, the statement added, with ""limited current demand"" in the UK.
A spokesperson for Weir confirmed ""up to 250"" roles at the Todmorden site ""could potentially be at risk"".
Councillor Sarah Courtney, regeneration cabinet member at Calderdale Council, said: ""As a resident of the town, I know many people who would be affected by its closure if this went ahead.
""We will do all we can to support people.""
The Unite union, which represented some employees, said ""meaningful discussions"" would be held with Weir in the coming days.
Regional officer Chris Muscroft said: ""We will leave no stone unturned in seeking alternatives to the current proposals and ensuring our members' best interests are prioritised.""
Weir said it was ""committed to minimising redundancies"".

Denise Johnson, 42, died at the Ipswich Hospital from a number of health issues following abdominal pain in November 2022.
Assistant coroner for Suffolk, Daniel Sharpstone, published a prevention of future deaths report where he raised concerns about discussions staff had with family as well as a lack of clarity over situations involving unexpected staff leave.
East Suffolk and North Essex Foundation Trust (ESNEFT), which is responsible for the the hospital, said it was ""committed to taking forward lessons learned"" after the Ipswich mum's death. 
Ms Johnson was admitted as an emergency with abdominal pain and jaundice in August 2022, according to Dr Sharpstone's report.
She underwent a endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) - a type of gastric endoscopic procedure - after a gallstone was found to be causing her jaundice.
However Dr Sharpstone said in his report Ms Johnson become ""acutely unwell"" and was diagnosed with acute necrotising pancreatitis.
She was admitted into intensive care for nine days with her care and treatment plans being managed by Ipswich Hospital with ""ongoing advice and guidance"" from a team at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridgeshire.
However her condition deteriorated and she died.
Dr Sharpstone raised three main concerns in his report following Ms Johnson's inquest conclusion in December.
He concluded said there was a ""paucity of comprehensible and timely communication"" with Ms Johnson's next of kin and family concerning her management plans and treatment options.
Dr Sharpstone said in this situation ""two-way feedback"" played a ""vital role in maintaining patient wellbeing and safety"".
He also said at one point it was ""unclear"" who was responsible for Ms Johnson's pancreatic disease management after her consultant was off due to unexpected leave.
""A clear handover process at consultant surgeon level for unexpected leave enables continuation of care between health care professionals and teams with continuity and oversight of treatment and management plans,"" he added.
And he also concluded ERCP complications should be dealt within a formal setting with endoscopy staff present.  
He said that would then allow ""timely feedback"" to responsible ERCP practitioners when complications arose. 
Dr Martin Mansfield, deputy chief medical officer at ESNEFT offered his sympathies to Ms Johnson's family. 
""We welcome the coroner's report and we are committed to taking forward lessons learned,"" he said. 
""Patient safety is our top priority and we take the concerns raised in the report very seriously. 
""We are working to address the issues and our full response to the report will be shared with the coroner in due course.""

It aimed to unite the communities of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, Harwich in Essex and Orford Ness in Suffolk. 
Collecting Dreams, Shifting Futures has been funded by Historic England, which said it centres on inclusivity and working with diverse local communities. 
Organisers hoped to gather 150 stories and images which will be shown at public events from 28 to 30 May as part of the UK-wide Beach of Dreams Festival.
Tamsin Silvey, Historic England cultural programme curator, said: ""Through working with artists, people will have a chance to explore the heritage on their doorsteps, unearth hidden histories and celebrate what makes their towns so special. 
""The project will also enable people to reflect on the future of their places as this coastline changes.""
The project, run by community-driven art and design organisation Kinetika, is a partnership between Essex Book Festival, covering Harwich and Orford Ness, and Out There Arts, covering Great Yarmouth. 
In Harwich, walking tours, workshops and community engagement days were organised with the Connect without Limits Autism Group, African Families in the UK and Refugee, Asylum Seekers and Migrant Action.
The festival team also worked with photographer/filmmaker Lucia Barbagallo and writer Emma Kittle-Pey to access the coastal nature reserve Orford Ness, with the support of its manager, the National Trust. 
Essex Book Festival director Ros Green said: ""Orford Ness and Harwich, both steeped in history, have different stories to tell - it has been a privilege finding out more about these two extraordinary coastal destinations.""
In Great Yarmouth, Out There Arts produced 13 events, including historic research at libraries, heritage walks and community talks led by local historians, story gathering sessions and pennant design workshops.
One participant, David Ball said he had not previously been ""aware of the rich history in Yarmouth"". 
""For me, it showed that, even without climate change, the seashore on the East coast has always been a dynamic environment,"" he added. 
The stories, memories and images will inspire written work, drawings and photographs created by artists. 
These will be revealed to the public in digital content and as silk pennants, which will be on display during free Beach of Dreams Festival events across Harwich, Orford Ness and Great Yarmouth.

236,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0yzg9pj97o,2025-01-24,Anti-abortion activists demand more than just pardons from Trump,"Anti-abortion activists who gathered in Washington DC have criticised President Donald Trump for not supporting an end to national abortion access, one day after he issued pardons to 23 activists, including some convicted of blockading a reproductive health clinic and intimidating staff and patients.
Coleman Boyd, who was among those pardoned by Trump on Thursday, said at the annual March for Life rally that Trump should support a national abortion ban, something he has said he would veto if such a law were to be passed by Congress. 
""I'm very thankful that he pardoned us. I think he's done lots of amazing things in the first week. I just think he is bad off on abortion,"" Mr Boyd, 53, told BBC News. 
""I think he is a horrible president when it comes to abortion.""
Trump addressed the annual gathering in a pre-recorded video message on Friday, in which he vowed to ""stop the radical Democrat push for a federal right to unlimited abortion-on-demand"".
He referred to his role in appointing a conservative-majority Supreme Court which overturned the national right to abortion in 2022. 
""That historic wrong was set right three years ago. I was so proud to be a participant,"" he said.
The March for Life rally has been held in the US capital every year since 1974, a year after abortion was legalised by the Supreme Court in Roe v Wade.
Mr Boyd, who travelled from Nashville to be in Washington after he was pardoned, said that Trump is ""misguided"" in his belief that abortion rights should be decided by individual states. 
""He is way less pro-life than he was back in 2016. But I think absolutely he is a potential ally,"" said Mr Boyd, who believes there all abortion should be banned, including in cases of rape and incest. 
Other rally-goers, including a woman named Rosie who spoke to the BBC, praised Trump for his role in overturning Roe v Wade, but said he must do more to make abortion a ""non-option"".
""I love that Roe v Wade was overturned but maybe put some legislation into office to incentivise people not to have abortion,"" said a man named David who was standing with her in the crowd of thousands.
During his campaign against former Vice-President Kamala Harris, Trump treaded lightly on the issue of abortion, an issue that galvanised female voters during the 2022 midterm elections and one that Democrats highlighted with their message of reproduction access rights. 
In October, one month before the election, he posted on social media in all-capital letters: ""Everyone knows I would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances, and would, in fact, veto it, because it is up to the states to decide based on the will of the their voters.""
But many at the rally say he should do more to block first-term abortions, and access to abortion medications which can be purchased online and sent via the mail.
Other prominent Republicans also spoke at the rally, including Vice-President JD Vance, who appeared in person to praise Trump's second term in office as the ""return of the most pro-family, most pro-life American president of our lifetime"".
On Thursday, Trump signed pardons for 23 activists, telling reporters: ""They should not have been prosecuted. Many of them are elderly people... this is a great honour to sign this. They'll be very happy.""
Among those pardoned is Lauren Handy, leader of the group Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising (PAAU).
The group was convicted of conspiring in 2020 to storm a Washington reproductive health clinic and block access to intimidate patients and staff. Members forced their way into the Surgi-Clinic, injuring a nurse, and spent several hours inside.
Handy was found guilty in August 2023 and sentenced in May 2024.
The president of Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America, Marjorie Dannenfelser, said the protesters were targeted by Joe Biden's Department of Justice and she thanked Trump for ""immediately delivering on his promise"" to pardon them.

Alex Gibson, 48, was diagnosed with the disease in 2018 and soon after set up the charity Challenging MND.
He set out to cover 24,000 metres (15 miles) on a rowing machines by completing 1,000m (3,280ft) every hour, but he smashed his target and reached 30,000 metres. The rest of the group of 60 - aged from six up to 79 - ended up rowing 605,571 metres (375 miles) between them using two machines.
In total, the group raised about £7,000 and Mr Gibson said it was a ""tremendous challenge"".
His distance was limited to 1,000 metres per hour due to his condition, which affects the brain and nerves.
""I am very pleased it was done and in front of my good friends and colleagues,"" he said.
""Everyone who made an effort should receive equal recognition and praise.""
The row was Mr Gibson's 10th charity challenge, having previously climbed the height of Mount Everest by walking up the Leadenhall Building in London 47 times, and setting a record for the fastest time pedalling a distance equivalent to the length of the River Thames.
Mr Gibson said he was told by his neurologist that he had significantly outlived the average life expectancy of someone with MND.
Charity Marie Curie said a person with MND would usually die between two to three years after diagnosis.
The father-of-two said: ""Discipline and determination are key: this is something I've learned and retained from my sporting days.""
Former England rugby player Andy Long, a patron for the charity, said: ""It's fantastic watching Alex with all his friends around him taking on a challenge - it means so much to him.
""The money raised goes to help those living with MND right now, and that's so important.""
Louis Payne, 31, who also took part in the challenge, said: ""I couldn't think of a better reason to get out and do something.

The government manages the majority of roads but smaller country roads are maintained by the 12 individual parishes. 
A main road in St Helier is set to remain closed to traffic until April after a burst water main caused a sinkhole and damage to surrounding buildings.
Andy Jehan, minister for infrastructure, said the government spent over £6m annually on maintaining the roads, with about £700,000 spent a year ""to repair potholes"".
One man told BBC Radio Jersey: ""They're a mess. They're full of potholes and they [government] haven't co-ordinated digging them up"" whereas a lady said there was ""no maintenance"".
""They're not spending enough just on the maintenance of the roads.""
Mr Jehan said damage could be caused by a multitude of issues and that the government worked closely with household services including gas, water and electricity.
He said: ""We have monthly meetings with all the services and there's a procedure for them to reinstate the work... we have people out on the roads every day inspecting roads and reporting back.
""I would say there's been underinvestment in our infrastructure for many, many years and we can only do what we can with the money that we're given.""
Mr Jehan said if the department was afforded further funding, it ""could do more each year"".
He said: ""I keep banging the drum for us to get further investment in our infrastructure. 
""Not just roads but the drains that go underneath them - I'll continue fighting that corner.""
Constable of St Peter Richard Vibert said there were 41 roads in the parish that the ratepayer was responsible for.
He said: ""When it comes to potholes, reports are sent into the parish hall... about every six weeks we bring those together and go out to a contractor to quote for repairs.""
He added that Mr Jehan had ""a much bigger responsibility"" to keep the main public roads maintained.

Preliminary plans for a lido, which would be the first to open in the city in decades, have been approved by Manchester City Council. 
The lido would be a key feature of the Holt Town redevelopment, which focuses on a 74-acre (30 hectare) site between Ancoats and SportCity. 
The open-air pool would be built on Cyrus Street, a currently overgrown back road which connects Cavalier Street to Cambrian Street.
Councillor Gavin White, executive member for housing and development, said the site was currently a well-known fly-tipping hotspot.
Council Leader Bev Craig said the National Association of Lidos had welcomed the plans, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
Speaking at a council meeting on Wednesday, Craig said the site was currently home to fewer than 100 people and ""does not have too much going on"".
The Galleon in East Didsbury and Alexandra Park's lido both closed in the 1980s.

The clock at All Saints Church in Thurlaston was installed in January 1876 but was removed in September after it stopped working and was sent away for repair.
The £20,000 restoration project has been carried out by Mansfield-based Timed Assured.
Clock manufacturers from the company have been abseiling down the tower to complete the work.
""This clock is in the centre of the village and is visible to everyone who goes by,"" said Philippa England, a member of the parochial church council for All Saints Church.
""The clock has not been right for some years. If you looked at the photographs that were taken before it went for repair, it just did look really tired and sad.
""To see it now, with the new faces going up, it is quite fantastic to watch.""
Meetings to discuss the renovation project began in September 2023. 
The re-development has received support from community groups.
""I was one of the first people to ask about renovating the church clock,"" said Marion Tarratt, the treasurer of the Carnival Committee which donated £7,600 to the project.
""It was so sad to see the clock forlorn. It means so much to so many different people and the community is delighted that it is being refurbished,"" added Ms Tarratt.

Queens Park in Caterham, which opened in 1900, will benefit from a £1.4m project to add several new features, Tandridge District Council has said.
These include a new accessible playground, a study area, more tree planting and a refreshment kiosk.
Council leader Catherine Sayer said: ""Queens Park has been an important part of our community for 125 years.""
There will also be new measures to prevent flooding and improve biodiversity.
A planning application for the new kiosk has yet to be submitted.
Ms Sayer added: ""These improvements will make sure it remains a welcoming and accessible space for everyone to enjoy, while addressing important issues like flood protection and biodiversity.""

Romarni Spencer and Pharrell McLennon, now both 18, fired at another teenager on a bicycle, but missed, outside the Bridgeway Centre in The Meadows, Nottingham, on 5 May last year.
CCTV from the scene was shown in court, and depicted three adults and a child rushing back into a nearby Co-op as the shots were fired.
On Friday, Spencer, of Marlborough Road, Beeston, received an extended sentence of 10 and a half years, while McLennon, of Maypole, Clifton, was handed an extended sentence of 13 years.
Prosecuting, Richard Thatcher said Spencer and McLennon arrived at the scene as part of a larger group, but then separated from the crowd on a motorbike.
They headed towards the target, who was by the Co-op store in the Bridgeway Centre, and ""both pointed their respective weapons at a third party"", he told the court.
The pair were arrested two days later at East Midlands Airport (EMA) as they tried to flee to Spain, Nottingham Crown Court heard.
Both teenagers had both previously pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, the court was told.
Sentencing them, Judge James Sampson said: ""You tried to shoot your intended target, both firing in quick succession. You missed your intended target.
""Emerging from this store, as events were unfolding, were a family who quickly retreated to take cover, no doubt terrified about what was unfolding.""
The court also heard the guns used in the attack had never been recovered.
Spencer and McLennon will spend their respective sentences in a young offenders institution.

Ports of Jersey CEO, Matt Thomas made the comment following news of government investment aimed at persuading more carriers to fly into Jersey.
He said he was ""very confident"" that flights to destinations like Paris and Frankfurt would be available within five years. 
Earlier this week ministers confirmed plans to spend £2m over the next two years on the project.
Speaking after the announcement, Mr Thomas said the investment of public funds makes Jersey a ""more exciting prospect to some airlines"".
""We are at the table. We are very, very competitive in terms of what it costs to land and turn around your plane in Jersey"", he said.
He also said there were more than 20 airlines that don't currently fly to Jersey Ports of Jersey is in regular contact with.
He added Jersey needed to prove it could deliver ""value for money for tourists and businesses"" to make it viable for airlines.
Visit Jersey will also receive a separate grant in order to market Jersey as a holiday destination in any of the places where new routes are secured.
It will receive £4m over the next two years, the majority of which will be spent on ""route marketing"". 
Tricia Warwick, chief executive of Visit Jersey, said: ""It's all about creating connectivity into Europe, and the main markets that we're focused on developing are France and Germany.
""You've got to have a compelling reason for them to come, and value for money is part of that.""
Making the funding announcement, Deputy Kirsten Morel said: ""If Jersey is to succeed in having sustainable air routes over many years they have to deliver that to the airlines and that's where the better business support package comes in.
""It provides that incentive for the airlines to try it, but if an airline sees that it's not getting the return it wants it will cut any link.""
Earlier this month, airline Blue Islands announced plans to fly direct to three European destinations, Bilbao, Verona and Munich, later this year.

A pilot programme with Dorset County Hospital, Dorchester, has seen musicians visit weekly to play and run music activities.
The orchestra's artist-in-residence, violinist Alena Baeva, recently performed before giving a recital.
The hospital said it had ""already seen a positive impact"" for patients, families and staff since it started in the summer.
The musicians have been visiting the stroke unit, children's department and elderly care ward.
The hospital said the music had been seen to help calm younger patients, and therapists in the stroke unit had reported improved recovery through physical musical activities.
Patients with advanced dementia have also taken part in group singing to spark memories and conversations.
Matthew Bryant, chief executive at Dorset HealthCare and Dorset County Hospital, said: ""Music is such an important part of everyday life for so many people, and we want to bring music and other creative arts into the healthcare environment to help healing and rehabilitation, and to make the hospital environment feel more normal.
""We can already see the positive impact of this for patients, families and staff - the difference the BSO musicians can make to how people feel is truly inspiring.""

Cheltenham Town FC has produced a one-off shirt, which will be worn on Saturday, to help raise funds for the British Heart Foundation (BHF).
Footballers are more at risk of dying from cardiac issues compared to men of similar age, according to data.
Sam Stubbs, Cheltenham defender, said: ""It's a good initiative and it's obviously an important cause, so it's brilliant the club can help.""
Every shirt that is sold will raise £5 for the charity and the club will auction off the match-worn shirts after the game.
""A few of the ex-pros, men and women, who've had a heart condition, we've talked about them, what to do, what not to do. 
""It's something that we're all briefed on and if you're a footballer or not, it's vitally important,"" Mr Stubbs added.
Heart issues in the sport have been highlighted by the likes of footballers Christian Eriksen and Tom Lockyer, who both collapsed during games.
Luke Saunders, the club's marketing manager, said: ""It's great for the charity and it's great for the club as well, because we've got the platform to be able to get the message out.""
Every week in the UK, 12 people aged under 35 die from sudden cardiac arrest.
And in the UK each year, 30,000 cardiac arrests happen outside of hospitals - all requiring emergency resuscitation, with just one in 10 people surviving.
Louise Gallard, fundraising manager for the BHF, said: ""We're immensely grateful to Kohler Mira for donating their shirt sponsorship to us. This initiative is part of their year-long support of our work which has seen them raise £50,000 for our research into heart and circulatory diseases.
""It's going to be very exciting to see Cheltenham Town take the field wearing this special strip, and hopefully they can mark the occasion with a famous win.""

Police warned early of fallen trees on a number of A-roads, while the M48 Severn Bridge was closed due to high winds. 
Bristol Airport has cancelled a number of flights throughout the day to Ireland and Scotland. 
The entire region has been covered by a Met Office yellow weather warning for high winds, with some delays to travel expected.
Flood warnings are in place in Salisbury where properties near the River Bourne and River Avon could be at risk of flooding.
Meanwhile high water levels are expected to cause flooding around the River Parrett from South Perrott to Thorney and on the River Yeo between Sherbourne and Yeovil.
Flood alerts are also in place for a number of locations across Somerset, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire.
Thousands of residents were also left without power, with outages reported widely across the region. 
Power cuts affected hundreds of properties at the peak of reported problems earlier, but the majority of these homes have now been reconnected.
There has also been disruption on roads across the area. 
Lower Hanham Road in Hanham is reportedly closed to both cars and pedestrians due to a fallen mains electricity cable, causing delays to traffic. 
In Gloucestershire, the 33 bus is also being diverted due to a fallen tree on Dean Common Road, Mitcheldean. 
Avon and Somerset Police said earlier that the A38 in Barrow Gurney, near Bristol Airport, the westbound side of the A39 at Cannington and the westbound side of the A303 near South Petherton had been closed due to fallen trees overnight. 
The A433 near Westonbirt Arboretum, between Bowldown Road and the A46 was also closed in both directions due to a fallen tree. 
However all of these routes are now believed to be back open.  
Meanwhile the M48 Severn Bridge was closed in both directions and one lane on the M5 southbound between Junction 19 and Junction 20 was closed due to surface water.

The 400-acre Laver Leisure scheme for Moneystone Quarry, near Cheadle, was granted outline approval in 2016, but nearby residents have been fighting the plans since 2011 when the quarry shut.
Final plans for phase one of the development, comprising about 190 holiday lodges, were refused by the local authority in 2023 but that has now been overturned by a planning inspector.
An application for the second phase, which could take the total number of lodges up to 250, has yet to be decided.
Laver Leisure was also previously granted permission for smaller elements of the scheme which included converting a former laboratory building on the site into a visitor centre.
Developers say the first phase of the project will see construction of a central hub building - to include a farm shop, gym, swimming pool, spa, restaurant/cafe, bowling alley, cinema room, games room and visitor centre - as well as 190 holiday lodges.
The first part of the development will also include outdoor amenities such as children's play areas, a multi-use games area, vehicle and cycle parking, footpaths, cycleways and bridleways.
The second phase of the development would see an additional 60 holiday lodges, taking the total to 250.
Staffordshire Moorlands District Council is expected to make a decision on the second phase early this year.
Laver Leisure said the new holiday park would provide about 250 full-time permanent jobs when it opened, as well as 230 construction jobs while it was being built.
Councillor James Aberley said residents were disappointed to see the plans approved.
""Locally, nobody sees any benefit to this,"" he said.
He added it would bring ""additional traffic chaos"" and that the completed scheme would be larger than the combined size of its two neighbouring villages, Whiston and Oakamoor.
""Locally the residents feel the planning inspector and council have ignored all the valid concerns about the application and about the appearance of the lodges that are proposed.""
The company said the proposed development was in line with the council's planning and tourism policies, and that it would aim for 40% of goods and services on site to be provided by local businesses.

249,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7e8x510j9o,2025-01-24,"Thousands of drivers paying invalid fines, AA says","Thousands of drivers across London have been paying invalid penalty charge notices (PCNs) due to enforcement and restriction cameras that relied upon expired Traffic Management Orders (TMOs) or lacked updated certification, according to the AA.
Recent rulings by London Tribunals' traffic adjudicators show at least six councils have issued such PCNs.
The AA raised concerns about those who appealed against the penalty and did not have their PCNs cancelled after the first complaint.
The Department for Transport (DfT) said a revamp of TMOs which govern local road restrictions was now being proposed.
London boroughs Lambeth, Harrow, Redbridge and Greenwich, Croydon and the City of London were unable to provide paperwork to validate some of the PCNs they had issued in the three weeks to 4 January.
According to court documents in one case involving Croydon Council on 16 December, an appeal against a PCN was allowed because the TMO the council mentioned expired 12 days before the alleged contravention, and evidence of any valid replacement order was not provided.
In another case heard on the same day involving the City of London Corporation, an appeal against a PCN was allowed because the Corporation relied, in its evidence, on a TMO which had expired the month before the alleged contravention.
The adjudicators cancelled these penalties, but the AA believes this is just ""the tip of the iceberg"".
An analysis by AA, based on London Councils statistics, showed 56% of appeals made against bus lane penalties last year were either upheld or not contested.
For moving traffic offences such as stopping in a yellow box when not allowed, the figure was 35%.
Altogether, nearly 7,300 appeals were successful.
But hundreds of drivers who received these PCNs paid within 14 days to secure the 50% discount for early settlement, the AA said.
Both Croydon Council and the City of London refute the AA's analysis.
Southwark News reported that last year, 4,478 PCNs amounting to a total of more than £500,000 resulted from motorists entering a bus lane in Rotherhithe that did not have a valid TMO. 
Luke Bosdet, from the AA's motoring policy unit, said: ""Dishing out fines for any restriction that has expired is outrageous.
""The lack of accountability for councils' road traffic enforcement needs to be reviewed by the Department for Transport,"" he said.
A DfT spokesman said: ""Local authorities are responsible for local traffic measures and they should make sure penalties for the use of bus lanes are fair and proportionate.
""They must ensure their Traffic Management Orders are up to date, and we will be sharing proposals to modernise this process, making it more efficient for local authorities.""
A London Councils spokesperson said it could not comment on decisions made by individual London boroughs as ""it was not the decision-maker in the examples cited by the AA"". 
""We encourage any motorist who does not believe that the PCN should have been issued to make representations to the local authority, and then appeal any rejected decision with London Tribunals. The independent adjudicator exists for the very reason of dealing with difficult cases,"" they added.
Data from the organisation shows a total of 16,351 appeal decisions were made for moving traffic contraventions in 2023-24. 
A total of 3,453,439 moving traffic PCNs were issued in the city, meaning 0.47% of them progressed to appeal.

250,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cre8n09rqx3o,2025-01-24,Consultation pushes bus franchising a step closer,"Plans to franchise bus services in a county have moved a step closer after results of a public consultation came out largely in favour of the move. 
The Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority (CPCA) said there were ""potential pathways for improving bus services for local communities"" through a franchising model.
It said franchising would give the authority control over routes, frequency and fares, whereas an alternative ""partnership solution"" would give it less control.
At a meeting earlier, councillors recommended the authority's mayor, Dr Nik Johnson, goes ahead with the scheme.
Currently, bus services in the region are mainly run by private operators that have control over the routes, timetables, ticket options, fares and frequency of buses.
Under the proposed franchising model, the CPCA would gain control over these areas and private operators would no longer be able to independently decide to withdraw services.
Instead, operators would bid to run services under franchise contracts, with the CPCA overseeing the process and monitoring operations.
The consultation took place between 14 August and 20 November.
A report put before the CPCA's transport committee meeting on 24 January showed that 1,468 participants in the consultation provided an answer to whether they supported or opposed the bus franchising proposals, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
A total of 42% of responses strongly supported franchising, with a further 21% tending to support, meaning that 63% of participants were largely in favour of the new model.
The committee unanimously voted to recommend that the mayor chooses franchising and he is due to make a final decision early next month.
Dr Johnson said: ""I think, long term, it's going to be so important that we get this right for the whole of our populations across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.""
According to a combined authority report, the total operational costs for franchising would be £9.65m.
The franchising option would require the combined authority to acquire bus depots. 
The capital costs of depots in the outline business case is £31m, funded by a £5m non-ringfenced capital grant, £4m of ringfenced capital and £22m of borrowing.
The authority said a number of factors would be taken into account ahead of any approved proposed franchising scheme, including investigating the benefits of longer mobilisation periods for some contracts, where this would support greater competition, and allow operators time to prepare franchising tenders.

They were interred at Frankby, Plymyard and the Landican in Wirral between 1935 to 1981, Wirral Council said. 
Councillor Ian Lewis told a meeting this week that ""with the benefit of hindsight it should never have happened"".
Like Oldham Council, the authority has said it wants put its one million burial records online, which would offer hope to families still searching for where their babies were buried. 
Wirral Council has held a number of services over the years providing support for families, while staff at its cemeteries have worked hard to help families try to locate their loved ones.
A memorial plaque was also installed by the local authority in 2023.
Before the 1980s, it was common practice across the UK that when a woman had a miscarriage or a stillbirth, hospital staff would quickly take the baby away and buried it in one of the communal graves.
Matthew Humble said Oldham and Wirral councils were doing far more than other authorities around the country who had a similar history of communal graves, adding: ""It would be helpful if the government did support local authorities in seeking to address this issue in a meaningful way.""
The Local Democracy Reporting Service writes that two campaigners for an apology also addressed  the meeting. 
Gina Jacobs, who gave birth to her son Robert in 1969, was inspired to locate her baby at Landican cemetery in Wirral after 53 years after watching a BBC programme.
Over 1,000 babies are buried at the Landican alone. 
Mrs Jacobs told councillors stories of fathers who had to carry their stillborn children on the bus in a box tied up with string and families who had been unable to find where their child was buried despite having the receipts for the burial. 
""I dread to think what I would be thinking if my baby couldn't be found,"" she told councillors.
Diana Williams, who lost her son John at Clatterbridge Hospital in 1971, thought he was buried at Barnston, but later discovered he was buried in Landican.
Mrs Williams added: ""Nobody knew and that is really hard to take in. It really is, the parents weren't consulted on most things.""
Councillor Grahame McManus told the meeting his family had been personally affected.
He said: ""We have looked for that auntie for years and years and we have never been able to find her. 
""Maybe now we will have a chance.""

The mural in Camborne town centre was daubed with name tags within hours of it being completed.
Cosmic, the mural's artist, said he restored the artwork which is on the shutters of an empty shop, in 25 minutes.
Devon and Cornwall Police said a 17-year-old Camborne boy had been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and had been released on bail.
The artwork features brothers Joel, Josh and Sam Matavesi, who have all played rugby locally.

Kevin Pittuck-Bennett, 46, and his husband Michael, 38, from Chelmsford, had their two-month-old daughter, Peggy, in 2024 via surrogacy, which is when a woman carries a pregnancy for another couple or individual. 
In the UK commercial surrogacy is illegal and a third party cannot profit from matching people, but it is not illegal for a surrogate to be paid expenses.
Mr Pittuck-Bennett, who works in advertising, made videos throughout the process with Michael, who is a hairstylist, to help others navigate surrogacy with ""less complications"". 
""It's a humbling process,"" Mr Pittuck-Bennett said, ""there are all sorts of emotions that we weren't prepared for.""
Surrogacy laws have been in place in the UK since 1985. 
The law states a surrogate is deemed the legal mother when the baby is born - irrespective of genetics or any agreements that have been made.
A parental order must be made to transfer legal parentage to the intended or biological parents.
Parental orders in England and Wales rose from 117 in 2011 to 413 in 2020.
In 2021 statistics showed that two-thirds of applicants for parental orders are now mixed-sex couples often in their 30s or 40s.
Kevin and Michael started the process of having a family via surrogacy in 2021, but quickly realised there was a lack of information available. 
Sarah Jones, the chief executive officer at Surrogacy UK, said: ""The UK surrogacy community in the UK is really unique in the fact that we operate altruistically, so nobody is allowed to make profit, nobody is allowed to financially profit from surrogacy in the UK.""
Kevin and Michael said they have kept in touch with their surrogate two months after the birth of their daughter.
Mr Pittuck-Bennett said :  ""The whole ethos of surrogacy is friendship first. She is going to be a part of our lives forever. She's definitely a special auntie. We do feel we are bonded for life.
""You've got an element of guilt because someone is doing this for you and they don't have to. Then you've got the worry because they're ill and the potential baby could be unwell,"" Mr Pittuck-Bennett added.
""I buried my head in the sand because we could only deal with so much. When we weren't talking to our lovely surrogate, we were doing life as normal. 
""We learnt that you don't have much control over the process. The power is with the surrogate and you hope that they choose you.
""You have to put yourself out there and be attractive to ladies who want to do this wonderful thing for you. 
""Of course they should have the power, it's their body.""
Mr Pittuck-Bennett  documented the couple's journey chronologically on YouTube, to provide information for others. 
""I'm not a professional expert, but I've lived it and done it.
""Hopefully it will help same-sex and straight couples figure out the rules and navigate the process.""
Ms Jones said: ""The laws around surrogacy are really straightforward, it is really hard to find that information because I think everything is geared up towards US surrogacy and the commercial model.
""There is a really thriving UK surrogacy community and there are various ways you can interact with that community.""
Helen Gibson, the founder of the campaign group, Surrogacy Concern, said: ""We don't support surrogacy for anyone, we understand that a lot of people want to have a genetic child of their own, but it is very exploitative for women.
""No-one looks at it from the perspective of the child"" who needs their biological mother when they are first born, she said.
""Fostering, adoption and co-parenting are all options before surrogacy.""

Defence Secretary John Healey announced the eight-year contract, called Unity, on Friday during a visit to the firm's nuclear reactor production facility in Derby. 
It is hoped it will create more than 1,000 UK jobs and safeguard 4,000 other roles.
Healey said Derby had a crucial role to play in protecting the United Kingdom at a time when it was ""facing rising threats and aggression"".
Unity is designed to make the design, manufacture and support services for reactors more efficient and environmentally friendly.
The government said the agreement would streamline previous contracts and incentives, and provide more efficient delivery, leading to savings of £400m.
As well as providing support to the current UK Royal Navy submarine fleet, Unity includes the build and commission of new Dreadnought Class submarines and the beginning of contracts for the new Aukus defence alliance.
In March 2023, it was announced Rolls-Royce would provide the reactors for the new fleet of nuclear submarines in a defence agreement between the UK, US and Australia.
The submarines will be built in Britain and Australia but use technology from all three countries.
The company opened a new Nuclear Skills Academy in Derby in 2022, designed to provide 200 apprenticeships each year for at least a decade.
Healey used the visit to highlight the government's ""triple lock"" on the nuclear deterrent, which includes building four new nuclear submarines in Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, maintaining the UK's continuous at sea nuclear deterrent and delivering all future upgrades needed.
He said: ""This investment in Britain's defence will deliver a long-term boost to British business, jobs and national security.
""In line with our Plan for Change, this deal with Rolls-Royce, a historic British success story, will support high-skilled UK jobs, who equip the thousands of submariners that keep us all safe. 
""We are showing defence can be an engine for growth, while also driving better value for taxpayer money.""
When asked how significant Derby was to the UK's defence following this deal, the minister responded to say that the city ""couldn't be more important"", said the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Healey said: ""Rolls-Royce is a company that is a proud British brand. It made the engines that powered the Spitfires that kept our skies safe. It is now making the engines now that power our submarines and keeping our seas safe.
""We are standing in the nuclear skills centre – a centre of excellence, not just in the UK but almost anywhere in the world. Rolls-Royce and the people who work here do things that nobody else in the world can do.
""We are proud to have them at the heart of our defence plans for the future. I'm proud as defence secretary to make this long-term commitment to Derby.""
The announcement comes days after Healey issued a warning to Russia in Parliament after a Russian spy ship was spotted around UK waters.
The minister added: ""Britain is safe, its people are safe and they are safe because of our armed forces and the extraordinary job they are prepared to do on behalf of us all. 
""But I don't want to mislead people either – we face rising threats and immediate aggression from Russia.""
Steve Carlier, president of Rolls-Royce Submarines, said: ""We're delighted to announce the Unity contract, which confirms our commitment to the Royal Navy and the Defence Nuclear Enterprise. 
""This long-term contract enables us to invest in the right skills, equipment and facilities to play our part in protecting UK interests at home and overseas.""
Rolls-Royce Submarines is already doubling the size of its Raynesway site and has recently started moving into specially-built warehouses in Pride Park.
General secretary of the Unite union, Sharon Graham, said: ""This announcement is good news for British jobs, good news for Derby and good news for our economy.
""Rolls-Royce has a world class workforce and the government is right to invest in it.""
Derby South MP Baggy Shanker said it was a great day for the city, and was ""a landmark deal between the government and Rolls-Royce"".
He added: ""It's important in protecting jobs, creating jobs and it is a really good deal for the UK taxpayers with a significant partnership announced which will make the deal more efficient for everybody.""

British Medical Association (BMA) members were set to strike for 48 hours on Wednesday, but action was called off while the deal from Manx Care is considered.
Local negotiation committee member Prakash Thiagarajan said most doctors accepted it was ""the best offer we can get"" in the current economic climate.
But he said he was ""reasonably confident"" the majority of members would support the deal after an online survey was issued imminently. 
If accepted, the new deal would see an 8% pay uplift for 2023-24, and 8% for the current year, with the 2024-25 award broken down into 6% backdated to 1 April last year with a further 2% added from 1 February 2025.
The BMA argued pay for some of its members had faced ""real term cuts"" of up to 19% since 2008.
The union had called for a 12.6% uplift for 2023-24, but that was rejected as ""unaffordable"" by Manx Care.
The island's health care provider is facing a £16.8m deficit this financial year, and has been tasked with making savings in a bid to balance its books.
Dr Thiagarajan said while the offer was ""the first major step towards pay restoration"", doctors could not ""rest here"".
""But it is an acknowledgement that doctors did deserve this pay rise,"" he said.
""We recognise the economic situation in the island and with Manx Care, as such this offer is the best that we could achieve at this stage.""
Asking for an improved offer would have ""necessitated prolonged and sustained industrial action, which doctors did not want to take"", he added.
Chairman of the BMA council Phil Banfield said doctors had been dedicated to ""improving their lives on the island"", and should not feel as though they ""have to go for jobs elsewhere"".
He said it had been ""disappointing"" strike action had been called for, but the new offer ""demonstrated a commitment to valuing the skills and expertise of doctors"".
The move was an ""opportunity to reset the relationship between Manx Care and its doctors, and that is of benefit to the public"", he added.

Oscar, known as the Tesco Cat due to his appearances at the shop in Stowmarket, Suffolk, was put down this month after being diagnosed with stomach cancer.
Customers who had grown fond of Oscar called for a statue to be put up inside the store in his honour, prompting cat-lover Sharon Kulesa to get creative.
But Tesco, which allowed flowers, cards and treats to be left in the shop after his death, told her it was no longer permitted to exhibit anything related to the friendly feline.
""I went to the ladies at the desk and said I had made a statue and had left it in the foyer but they said I couldn't do that,"" said Ms Kulesa, 45.
""It's quite large and I made a plinth for it, but it wasn't in the way.
""It's a such a shame and quite sad because Oscar was much-loved by me and my family, and I am a bit gutted I couldn't do what I wanted to.""
Last year, Oscar was nominated in the animal category of the BBC Suffolk Make a Difference awards for spreading joy within the community.
He was known for greeting shoppers at the store and sleeping on the trolleys outside.
Ms Kulesa spent two days working on the sculpture, using newspaper, tinfoil, masking tape and paint to capture Oscar's likeness.
But after presenting it to Tesco, she said she was told it would be unfair as former employees who had died were never afforded the same courtesy.
Ms Kulesa said Oscar's ties with the store were unique and a statue would be a fitting tribute – a sentiment echoed by Oscar's legion of fans.
""Hundreds of people have said how much they love it and said it is such a shame it cannot go in Tesco, so I think the people of Stowmarket have spoken,"" she said.
""Oscar loved Tesco, and if every store had a cat I would understand, but he was unique and much like a celebrity, and when celebrities die many want to pay tribute.
""And Oscar was a Stowmarket celebrity, and people want to honour him. So that makes it different.""
Wayne Leech, the manager at the store, said he and his team were saddened by Oscar's death and they had honoured him in their own way.
He added: ""Oscar was a regular visitor to the store and would help put a smile on the faces of colleagues and customers alike.
""We were glad to be able share the tributes customers left for Oscar with his owner, and make a donation from Tesco and our customers to a nearby cat charity in Oscar's name to mark his memory.""

Hertsmere Borough Council's planning committee has approved outline plans for the DC01UK development near the M25 South Mimms service station in Hertfordshire, that will cover 87,000 sq m.
Data centres are huge warehouses filled with computers that remotely power services such as streaming and artificial intelligence.
Jeremy Newmark, the leader of the council, described it as a ""momentous development for our borough"", although the project could be some years away from completion.
In the UK, data centres are set to be classified as critical national infrastructure, similar to the emergency services and energy and water supplies.
The developers said DC01UK would be ""Europe's largest cloud and AI data centre"".
Outline planning approval sets broad principles around the proposed development, but there will be further rounds of public consultation.
Newmark, chair of the Hertfordshire Growth Board, said: ""While outline planning permission has been granted, we will of course continue to listen to and engage with residents about these exciting plans as more details are firmed up.
""As I've said before, I'm sure local people will see the massive value this development could bring to our area.""
Peter Waine, chair of the Hertfordshire branch of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, questioned the decision to put the development on green belt land.
He said: ""It is a huge potential development, it is the biggest in Europe, and along with the proposed 1,000 houses that will be built adjacent there is going to be hardly any green belt between Potters Bar and the M25 at South Mimms.
""It may not be the most wonderful and beautiful green belt but it is green belt... I admit it's not the Lake District but it is land on our doorstep – it is open space.""
Newmark responded: ""We are not going to apologise as an authority for making a choice that is [to] the benefit of local people and provides critical national infrastructure that our country needs to deliver on the government's national growth mission.""
A spokesperson for DC01UK said: ""This approval will also solidify Hertsmere's status as a leading region... as a tech and media superhub, complementing other established, large technology-driven organisations and film studios in the area.
""Our plan will put Hertfordshire at the epicentre of the new data centre revolution, as well as creating £3.75bn for the economy during construction and almost 14,000 indirect jobs once operational.""

The first pre-festival events take place on Saturday, a week before the main event, to build excitement, organisers said.
They include a discussion on mixed heritage identity between Jassa Ahluwalia and Sathnam Sanghera, unearthing ""a journey of self-discovery"".
And the annual poetry slam will also take place with 15 poets going head to head at the Arena Theatre.
Georgina Cheung, festival organiser, said the poetry slam often saw people gathering outside because it was such a popular event.
She said live music events and dance performances are being held in the main festival line-up from 31 January to 2 February, inspired by ideas surrounding words.
""It's about storytelling, and engaging different types of storytellers,"" Ms Cheung said. ""It doesn't always have to be about reading.""
This year's programme includes events exploring the connection between hip hop, poetry and rap.
Live music events will look at lyricism and the use of words in music.
""And we have such amazing speakers with really powerful stories,"" she added.
She said they included Jordan Stephens from Rizzle Kicks discussing what it means to be a modern man in his talk headed Avoidance, Drugs, Heartbreak and Dogs.
And journalist and broadcaster Ashley John-Baptiste will be talking about his experiences of growing up in the British care system, she added.
""At the moment we are in the midst of final bits, getting the signage up and the stage prepped,"" Ms Cheung said.
She said organisers had a good number of volunteers but they were always looking for more.
The aim is to make sure every venue has staff and support for ticketing and helping people to find their way, Ms Cheung said.
She said people could still get in touch to help out.

Leek Moorlands Hospital was not mentioned in plans for MIUs in the area to become urgent treatment centres (UTCs), leading to fears it could be closed.
However Tracy Shewan, a director at Staffordshire Integrated Care Board (ICB), said there were ""no plans at the moment"" for any changes at the site.
Her view was echoed by MP Karen Bradley who said she had been given similar assurances at the end of last year.
""I was absolutely delighted to be told categorically that the services of the MIU are staying at the Leek Moorlands Hospital,"" Ms Bradley said.
""The community nurses are now based at the hospital, they've got a full time base there.
""We've got cognitive therapies, we've got blood testing facilities and x-rays and many other things.""
The NHS might decide to rename some of its sites, she said, but services currently offered at Leek MIU were not being transferred elsewhere.
Ms Shewan made the announcement after talking to the public to get their view.
""[They've] told us lots of information which we're really grateful for – around Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent – about services that they want and what they feel they need in their area,"" she said.
""I understand names are very important to some people, but for us it's actually the services that are the most important things – so people get the care they need at the right time and at the right place.""

Brinsley Headstocks is currently being re-erected after it was dismantled in 2023 because parts of its wooden structure were found to be rotten and unsafe.
On Tuesday, Broxtowe Borough Council said it had fenced off part of the nature reserve, near where the headstocks will be placed, after a survey located the uncapped shaft.
The authority has asked people to stay away from the area. 
A council spokesperson said: ""Other shafts on the site are approximately 250ft (76.2m) deep but there is no record of this shaft on the Coal Board plans. 
""It was only picked up by our team when they were checking old site plans. 
""They passed this information on to the site investigator who then identified the shaft.
""It is unlikely that this shaft will impact on the delivery programme of the headstocks.""
""Normally a mine shaft when it is closed down is filled firstly with rubble,"" the spokesperson added.
""It is then injected with cement to form a plug and then a concrete slab is placed on top. What was found was that the shaft was filled with rubble but there was no cement or concrete slab. 
""There is the possibility that the rubble in the shaft can settle and sink, which is why it is important to have a cap.""
The council added it was possible it may have to fence off a larger area as it carried out work to secure the mine shaft.
Mining ceased at Brinsley Colliery in 1934.
The headstocks were moved to another pit when the site closed and in 1970, they went to a mining museum, before returning to Brinsley - though not in the exact original position.
The pit employed the father of author D.H. Lawrence and it features in one of his books.
The council approved a plan to replace the lost headstocks earlier in January with a ""like-for-like"" replica.
The replacement timber headstocks towers measure 11m (36ft) and will retain the original structure's wheels.

Stuart Maxwell, who taught at The Ripley Academy in Ripley, Derbyshire, ""took the law into his own hands"" when he attacked a child, a misconduct hearing was told.
The Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) heard Mr Maxwell, 55, was convicted of assault following an incident off the school premises, at Sawley, in January 2022.
The TRA said on Wednesday that Mr Maxwell had been given an indefinite prohibition order, which would be reviewed after three years.
A report said Mr Maxwell's conduct ""fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession"".
It said: ""Whilst the panel recognised that the offence had taken place outside of the school setting, outside of school hours and had not involved pupils or other members of the academy's staff, the panel noted that the offence did involve a child of school age at a school where Mr Maxwell had taught.
""Although Mr Maxwell acted in the heat of the moment, he essentially took the law into his own hands and responded inappropriately to a situation where, on his account, he was being provoked by a child.""
Mr Maxwell ""had a duty to act as a role model"", the TRA added. 
Mr Maxwell was fined £120 and ordered to pay £100 compensation when he appeared before magistrates in June 2023 and was convicted of the assault.
In statement to the panel, he said he ""wholeheartedly"" regretted going to try to resolve a situation he had with the pupil.
He told the panel he had taken his ""eye off the ball and briefly put my responsibilities as a teacher to one side"".
Mr Maxwell said: ""I am extremely remorseful and will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life, as will my family.""

The Morgan and Morecambe Offshore Wind Farms scheme is set to see the cable come ashore near Starr Gate beach in Blackpool, which is regularly used by dog walkers and residents.
Developers have pledged to maintain public access ""as far as possible"".
Squires Gate ward councillor Gerard Walsh said he hoped any disruption at Starr Gate ""will be kept to a minimum"".
A Morgan and Morecambe Offshore Wind Farms Transmission Assets spokesperson said the project could generate enough electricity to power ""the equivalent of about two million UK homes every year and make an important contribution to the UK's renewable energy targets"".
However, they added projects of this scale and importance ""can't be delivered without potential impacts but we have sought to avoid and minimise these"".
They said it was ""committed to ensuring public access to the beach as far as possible"".
Mr Walsh said he hoped ""once the cable has been laid in a specific area then that area will be opened back up again, so any disruption at Starr Gate will be kept to a minimum"".
The proposed development involves two planned wind farms in the Irish Sea, around 22 miles off the Lancashire coast.
It would see undersea cables landing at Starr Gate beach, near Blackpool Airport, and running around 10 miles underground to two substations between Kirkham and Newton.
Campaigners against the scheme claim it would scar the land and cause extreme disruption while Fylde Council has also voiced concerns over the potential visual and agricultural impact and disturbance during construction.
The Planning Inspectorate is currently examining the project before a recommendation is given to the Secretary of State, who then has three months to issue a decision.

The former jail now operates as a tourist attraction, and has previously featured in TV dramas and celebrity reality show, Banged Up.
The role will see people lead evening tours around the site, helping the public investigate some of the paranormal activity.
Mr Campbell said the prison was home to many spirits, including a young boy he believes is from the Georgian times, and a male prisoner that pulls women's hair.
""If you're scared of the dark, you're probably going to struggle a little bit with the job.""
One of the first spirits he says he saw was the ""shadow man"", who appeared in the prison's A wing.
""[It was] basically just a shadow of a former male prison officer, around 6ft, who walks all the way along the back of the landings and just disappears into a cell,"" he said.
""It was one of those really weird things where I wasn't sure whether to be scared, excited or relieved to see something.""
He added that the prison's C wing is the most haunted in the entire building.
""It doesn't matter who you are, how brave you are, whether you believe in ghosts or don't believe in ghosts. When it is 3 o'clock in the morning and it is pitch black and you're the only person here, you walk faster down the landing than you would during the day.""
As for people looking to fill the ghost tour guide vacancies, Mr Campbell is looking for people with an interest in all things spooky.
""Obviously, as you would expect, they need to have a passion for the paranormal. And, they need to be not scared of the dark,"" he laughed.

267,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gx8pn798qo,2025-01-24,Clampdown on fake Google reviews announced,"Google has agreed to make ""significant changes to its processes"" to help tackle fake reviews of UK businesses, the regulator has announced.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says the firm - which accounts for 90% of search in the UK - will attach warnings to companies found to have artificially boosted their star rating.
The worst offenders will have their review function deactivated, meaning they cannot receive any new reviews.
Individuals who repeatedly post fake or misleading reviews will be banned from posting – regardless of where they are in the world.
Consumer group Which? called the changes ""a step in the right direction"" but said they would need to be backed up with strong enforcement action, potentially including ""heavy fines"" if Google failed to stick to them.
Sarah Cardell, the Chief Executive of the CMA, said: ""The changes we've secured from Google ensure robust processes are in place, so people can have confidence in reviews and make the best possible choices.""
The measures only relate to reviews for businesses when searching on Google or on Google maps. 
They will not apply to reviews of products.
A spokesperson from Google told the BBC: ""Our longstanding investments to combat fraudulent content help us block millions of fake reviews yearly – often before they ever get published.
""Our work with regulators around the world, including the CMA, is part of our ongoing efforts to fight fake content and bad actors.""
It is not the first pledge to tackle fake reviews, a problem which artificial intelligence (AI) is exacerbating.
Amazon and Google have been under investigation by the CMA over fake reviews since June, 2021 – months after the consumer group Which? concluded Google was failing to do enough to combat fake reviews within its business listings.
The CMA has said its investigation into Amazon is ongoing.
Rocio Concha, the director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said: ""Which? has repeatedly exposed fake reviews on Google, so the CMA securing these commitments from the tech giant is a step in the right direction. 
""The changes should help prevent consumers from being misled by unscrupulous businesses and fake review brokers.
""However, the regulator must monitor the situation closely and be prepared to use new enforcement powers secured through the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act to take strong action, including issuing heavy fines, if Google fails to make improvements.""
The influence of reviews real and fake is enormous - the CMA estimates £23bn of UK consumer spending every year is ""potentially influenced"" by online reviews.
Google told the BBC it has already started with its restrictions on businesses and reviews, and the CMA says Google will report to it over the next three years to ensure action is being taken.
After this period, Google will be able to change how it deals with fake reviews to reflect any new changes in technology.
Ms Cardell added: ""This is a matter of fairness – for both business and consumers – and we encourage the entire sector to take note.""

G-A-Y Bar owner Jeremy Joseph said he had had to make the ""tough decision"" after his other venue, Heaven nightclub, was temporarily closed late last year after a member of security staff allegedly raped a woman.
He criticised Westminster City Council and the Met Police as well as local residents' groups as being too resistant to measures, such as late licences, which he said would benefit the nightlife industry.
A council spokesperson said they were proud supporters of LGBT+ businesses and the wider community in Soho and Westminster, while the Met said it understood the ""complexities"" that night-time venues face.
""This isn't an easy decision. To me it is more than just a bar, it's also my home - I've lived above it for over 15 years,"" Mr Joseph said in a statement.
He added the closure of Heaven while its licence was under review had put G-A-Y Bar ""at risk financially"".
""Even now after Heaven's reopening, the damage financially and mentally has been irreparable,"" he said. 
The venue was closed at the request of the Met Police and reviewed by the council after the alleged rape. During the review process, a Met spokesperson called the venue the ""highest crime generator in the borough"".
New security measures were put in place, with police input, and the council's licensing committee allowed it to reopen last month.
After another one of his venues, G-A-Y Late, closed in 2023, he said he had planned to apply for a late licence for his remaining venue under that brand.
He later decided against this as he felt it would face too many objections from the council, police and residents.
""It's a constant uphill battle and another fight in the cost of living crisis which has negatively impacted all of the hospitality sector,"" he said.
""It doesn't feel like anyone with power cares about hospitality and it definitely doesn't feel like they care about LGBT venues.""
Mr Joseph also cited what he said was a wider decline in Soho as an ""LGBT capital"".
He said when he had opened the venue on Old Compton Street, it was the ""gayest street in the gayest capital"".

Leek Moorlands Hospital was not mentioned in plans for MIUs in the area to become urgent treatment centres (UTCs), leading to fears it could be closed.
However Tracy Shewan, a director at Staffordshire Integrated Care Board (ICB), said there were ""no plans at the moment"" for any changes at the site.
Her view was echoed by MP Karen Bradley who said she had been given similar assurances at the end of last year.
""I was absolutely delighted to be told categorically that the services of the MIU are staying at the Leek Moorlands Hospital,"" Ms Bradley said.
""The community nurses are now based at the hospital, they've got a full time base there.
""We've got cognitive therapies, we've got blood testing facilities and x-rays and many other things.""
The NHS might decide to rename some of its sites, she said, but services currently offered at Leek MIU were not being transferred elsewhere.
Ms Shewan made the announcement after talking to the public to get their view.
""[They've] told us lots of information which we're really grateful for – around Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent – about services that they want and what they feel they need in their area,"" she said.
""I understand names are very important to some people, but for us it's actually the services that are the most important things – so people get the care they need at the right time and at the right place.""

Brinsley Headstocks is currently being re-erected after it was dismantled in 2023 because parts of its wooden structure were found to be rotten and unsafe.
On Tuesday, Broxtowe Borough Council said it had fenced off part of the nature reserve, near where the headstocks will be placed, after a survey located the uncapped shaft.
The authority has asked people to stay away from the area. 
A council spokesperson said: ""Other shafts on the site are approximately 250ft (76.2m) deep but there is no record of this shaft on the Coal Board plans. 
""It was only picked up by our team when they were checking old site plans. 
""They passed this information on to the site investigator who then identified the shaft.
""It is unlikely that this shaft will impact on the delivery programme of the headstocks.""
""Normally a mine shaft when it is closed down is filled firstly with rubble,"" the spokesperson added.
""It is then injected with cement to form a plug and then a concrete slab is placed on top. What was found was that the shaft was filled with rubble but there was no cement or concrete slab. 
""There is the possibility that the rubble in the shaft can settle and sink, which is why it is important to have a cap.""
The council added it was possible it may have to fence off a larger area as it carried out work to secure the mine shaft.
Mining ceased at Brinsley Colliery in 1934.
The headstocks were moved to another pit when the site closed and in 1970, they went to a mining museum, before returning to Brinsley - though not in the exact original position.
The pit employed the father of author D.H. Lawrence and it features in one of his books.
The council approved a plan to replace the lost headstocks earlier in January with a ""like-for-like"" replica.
The replacement timber headstocks towers measure 11m (36ft) and will retain the original structure's wheels.

Stuart Maxwell, who taught at The Ripley Academy in Ripley, Derbyshire, ""took the law into his own hands"" when he attacked a child, a misconduct hearing was told.
The Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) heard Mr Maxwell, 55, was convicted of assault following an incident off the school premises, at Sawley, in January 2022.
The TRA said on Wednesday that Mr Maxwell had been given an indefinite prohibition order, which would be reviewed after three years.
A report said Mr Maxwell's conduct ""fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession"".
It said: ""Whilst the panel recognised that the offence had taken place outside of the school setting, outside of school hours and had not involved pupils or other members of the academy's staff, the panel noted that the offence did involve a child of school age at a school where Mr Maxwell had taught.
""Although Mr Maxwell acted in the heat of the moment, he essentially took the law into his own hands and responded inappropriately to a situation where, on his account, he was being provoked by a child.""
Mr Maxwell ""had a duty to act as a role model"", the TRA added. 
Mr Maxwell was fined £120 and ordered to pay £100 compensation when he appeared before magistrates in June 2023 and was convicted of the assault.
In statement to the panel, he said he ""wholeheartedly"" regretted going to try to resolve a situation he had with the pupil.
He told the panel he had taken his ""eye off the ball and briefly put my responsibilities as a teacher to one side"".
Mr Maxwell said: ""I am extremely remorseful and will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life, as will my family.""

272,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20pq51zj86o,2025-01-24,Beach could close for years for wind farm work,"A popular Lancashire beach faces disruption for up to three years while work gets under way to bring a wind farm cable ashore. 
The Morgan and Morecambe Offshore Wind Farms scheme is set to see the cable come ashore near Starr Gate beach in Blackpool, which is regularly used by dog walkers and residents.
Developers have pledged to maintain public access ""as far as possible"".
Squires Gate ward councillor Gerard Walsh said he hoped any disruption at Starr Gate ""will be kept to a minimum"".
A Morgan and Morecambe Offshore Wind Farms Transmission Assets spokesperson said the project could generate enough electricity to power ""the equivalent of about two million UK homes every year and make an important contribution to the UK's renewable energy targets"".
However, they added projects of this scale and importance ""can't be delivered without potential impacts but we have sought to avoid and minimise these"".
They said it was ""committed to ensuring public access to the beach as far as possible"".
Mr Walsh said he hoped ""once the cable has been laid in a specific area then that area will be opened back up again, so any disruption at Starr Gate will be kept to a minimum"".
The proposed development involves two planned wind farms in the Irish Sea, around 22 miles off the Lancashire coast.
It would see undersea cables landing at Starr Gate beach, near Blackpool Airport, and running around 10 miles underground to two substations between Kirkham and Newton.
Campaigners against the scheme claim it would scar the land and cause extreme disruption while Fylde Council has also voiced concerns over the potential visual and agricultural impact and disturbance during construction.
The Planning Inspectorate is currently examining the project before a recommendation is given to the Secretary of State, who then has three months to issue a decision.

The former jail now operates as a tourist attraction, and has previously featured in TV dramas and celebrity reality show, Banged Up.
The role will see people lead evening tours around the site, helping the public investigate some of the paranormal activity.
Mr Campbell said the prison was home to many spirits, including a young boy he believes is from the Georgian times, and a male prisoner that pulls women's hair.
""If you're scared of the dark, you're probably going to struggle a little bit with the job.""
One of the first spirits he says he saw was the ""shadow man"", who appeared in the prison's A wing.
""[It was] basically just a shadow of a former male prison officer, around 6ft, who walks all the way along the back of the landings and just disappears into a cell,"" he said.
""It was one of those really weird things where I wasn't sure whether to be scared, excited or relieved to see something.""
He added that the prison's C wing is the most haunted in the entire building.
""It doesn't matter who you are, how brave you are, whether you believe in ghosts or don't believe in ghosts. When it is 3 o'clock in the morning and it is pitch black and you're the only person here, you walk faster down the landing than you would during the day.""
As for people looking to fill the ghost tour guide vacancies, Mr Campbell is looking for people with an interest in all things spooky.
""Obviously, as you would expect, they need to have a passion for the paranormal. And, they need to be not scared of the dark,"" he laughed.

274,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gx8pn798qo,2025-01-24,Clampdown on fake Google reviews announced,"Google has agreed to make ""significant changes to its processes"" to help tackle fake reviews of UK businesses, the regulator has announced.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says the firm - which accounts for 90% of search in the UK - will attach warnings to companies found to have artificially boosted their star rating.
The worst offenders will have their review function deactivated, meaning they cannot receive any new reviews.
Individuals who repeatedly post fake or misleading reviews will be banned from posting – regardless of where they are in the world.
Consumer group Which? called the changes ""a step in the right direction"" but said they would need to be backed up with strong enforcement action, potentially including ""heavy fines"" if Google failed to stick to them.
Sarah Cardell, the Chief Executive of the CMA, said: ""The changes we've secured from Google ensure robust processes are in place, so people can have confidence in reviews and make the best possible choices.""
The measures only relate to reviews for businesses when searching on Google or on Google maps. 
They will not apply to reviews of products.
A spokesperson from Google told the BBC: ""Our longstanding investments to combat fraudulent content help us block millions of fake reviews yearly – often before they ever get published.
""Our work with regulators around the world, including the CMA, is part of our ongoing efforts to fight fake content and bad actors.""
It is not the first pledge to tackle fake reviews, a problem which artificial intelligence (AI) is exacerbating.
Amazon and Google have been under investigation by the CMA over fake reviews since June, 2021 – months after the consumer group Which? concluded Google was failing to do enough to combat fake reviews within its business listings.
The CMA has said its investigation into Amazon is ongoing.
Rocio Concha, the director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said: ""Which? has repeatedly exposed fake reviews on Google, so the CMA securing these commitments from the tech giant is a step in the right direction. 
""The changes should help prevent consumers from being misled by unscrupulous businesses and fake review brokers.
""However, the regulator must monitor the situation closely and be prepared to use new enforcement powers secured through the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act to take strong action, including issuing heavy fines, if Google fails to make improvements.""
The influence of reviews real and fake is enormous - the CMA estimates £23bn of UK consumer spending every year is ""potentially influenced"" by online reviews.
Google told the BBC it has already started with its restrictions on businesses and reviews, and the CMA says Google will report to it over the next three years to ensure action is being taken.
After this period, Google will be able to change how it deals with fake reviews to reflect any new changes in technology.
Ms Cardell added: ""This is a matter of fairness – for both business and consumers – and we encourage the entire sector to take note.""

G-A-Y Bar owner Jeremy Joseph said he had had to make the ""tough decision"" after his other venue, Heaven nightclub, was temporarily closed late last year after a member of security staff allegedly raped a woman.
He criticised Westminster City Council and the Met Police as well as local residents' groups as being too resistant to measures, such as late licences, which he said would benefit the nightlife industry.
A council spokesperson said they were proud supporters of LGBT+ businesses and the wider community in Soho and Westminster, while the Met said it understood the ""complexities"" that night-time venues face.
""This isn't an easy decision. To me it is more than just a bar, it's also my home - I've lived above it for over 15 years,"" Mr Joseph said in a statement.
He added the closure of Heaven while its licence was under review had put G-A-Y Bar ""at risk financially"".
""Even now after Heaven's reopening, the damage financially and mentally has been irreparable,"" he said. 
The venue was closed at the request of the Met Police and reviewed by the council after the alleged rape. During the review process, a Met spokesperson called the venue the ""highest crime generator in the borough"".
New security measures were put in place, with police input, and the council's licensing committee allowed it to reopen last month.
After another one of his venues, G-A-Y Late, closed in 2023, he said he had planned to apply for a late licence for his remaining venue under that brand.
He later decided against this as he felt it would face too many objections from the council, police and residents.
""It's a constant uphill battle and another fight in the cost of living crisis which has negatively impacted all of the hospitality sector,"" he said.
""It doesn't feel like anyone with power cares about hospitality and it definitely doesn't feel like they care about LGBT venues.""
Mr Joseph also cited what he said was a wider decline in Soho as an ""LGBT capital"".
He said when he had opened the venue on Old Compton Street, it was the ""gayest street in the gayest capital"".
""But it's not like that anymore,"" he added.
The nightclub owner said he wanted the G-A-Y Bar to remain an LGBT venue and he was also considering a franchising option to achieve that, but he believed it would not happen ""in the current climate"".
A Met Police spokesperson said: ""We work in partnership and as a community with local venues, residents and partners to understand the impact and issues at night. 
""We will always try to support venues as best we can to prevent and deter crime.

The 56-year-old, from Hampton Loade, near Bridgnorth, flew to the Chiang Rai province of Thailand to help save 12 boys who became trapped in a flooded cave in 2018.
""You never join a cave rescue team to be involved in an absolute world story,"" he said.
Mr Clayton described getting the call to help the rescue effort as both an honour and an obligation.
""I knew Thailand and I knew the cave. 
""I also knew diving and the equipment as someone who swims in open water, so yes I felt a sense of obligation to help.""
He had joined the rescue as a surface controller, providing support above ground and ensuring order was maintained.
Mr Clayton is the chair of Midlands Cave Rescue Organisation - a group of volunteers across the West Midlands who aid cave and land rescues.
The Wild Boars football team, aged 11 to 16, became trapped 2.5 miles (4km) inside the Tham Luang caves on 23 June 2018 after heavy rainfall.
""During the actual event, you're just concentrating on achieving it. You don't really think of the pressure,"" he told the BBC.
""It was pretty chaotic, with thousands of people on site wanting to all help and save them.""
Although the rescue was almost seven years ago, the intensity of the mission remains.
""It is something I'll never forget, feeling that pressure.
""We didn't have permission from the Thai government to actually start attempting a diving rescue, because they were nervous about the chances of survival for the boys.""
With the risk of monsoon rains beginning at any moment - time was not on their side.
From the Thai King to American Air force crew, Mr Clayton said it almost felt like the whole world had turned out to help.
""It was a whirlwind and was probably the most stressful two weeks of my life.

The force was under extra scrutiny for two and a half years, following a series of scandals including the murder of Sarah Everard, the strip-search of Child Q and officers being caught exchanging offensive messages.
HMICFRS said the force had made improvements, but also acknowledged there was still a “significant amount” of work to do.
Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the force’s progress had been ""extraordinary"" in a ""budget-constrained, shrinking Met"".
HMICFR‘s Lee Freeman said he was pleased with the progress the force had made so far and had ""recommended removing the service from our enhanced level of monitoring, known as Engage, and return it to routine monitoring"".
He acknowledged there was still a ""significant"" amount of work to do but added he was ""reassured"" by plans put in place to “continue making sustainable improvements"".
In response, the Met Police said officers and staff had worked tirelessly to address problems. 
It said a new strategy for the force was set out in July 2022 in the New Met for London plan - aimed at rebuilding the organisation. 
Sir Mark praised “the unwavering passion, sense of duty, courage and hard work of our officers and staff in the face of some incredibly challenging circumstances"".
He added: ""The whole of the Met has worked to fix our broken foundations and make sure our officers are set up to deliver for London.
""Their achievement is all the more extraordinary in a budget-constrained, shrinking Met which is facing increased demand.""
The commissioner told the BBC earlier the force would be ""shrinking faster"" next year.
He said: ""Our budget will be finalised over the end of the month but I haven't seen anything to suggest that we won't be losing a thousand officers and staff.""
He said the anticipated loss was ""concerning"". 
In December, the commissioner said the force needed an additional £450m; a week later the government announced it would provide an extra £65m.
The commissioner said that the force's exit from enhanced monitoring by the inspectorate showed it was on the ""right path"". 
The inspectorate found improvements in:
Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the force had ""many problems to deal with"", but said the news from the inspectorate was an ""important and welcome step"". 
She added: ""Everyone recognises that there is still more work that must be done to improve performance and restore public confidence, and I will continue to work closely with the commissioner and the mayor to ensure this is just the first step in a long-term mission to improve the Metropolitan Police and keep people safe across London.""
Analysis: Sonja Jessup, BBC London home affairs correspondent 
There's no doubt this is a significant moment for the Met.
The Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley, who came into the role a few months after the force was placed into the Engage process, has been under huge pressure to prove that his promises of reform are really delivering results.
The latest HMICFRS inspection is a show of confidence in its progress. But it is a first step. 
It will take time for Londoners, who regularly share their fears and frustration over crime and the police response to it, to see results and feel safer. 
And looming over today's good news headline is the commissioner's stark warning of ""eye-watering"" cuts if it doesn't secure more funding. 
Sir Mark says the Met has fixed the ""broken foundations"", but how solid are they?
Mayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan said the step forward by the force was ""down to the hard work of the force"", along with ""record investment and support from City Hall"".
He said: ""Having asked the HMI to look in particular at concerns around child sexual exploitation, it's reassuring that the Met Police have made significant improvements in this area.""
But, he also acknowledged ""there's still more to do"".
Last week the mayor announced that average council tax bills could go up by almost £19 a year to help pay for London's police and fire services.

The 12-acre Saxonvale site in Frome has been empty for decades, but a plan for more than 260 homes, a lido and a commercial space can now be taken forward by social enterprise Mayday Saxonvale.
The cost is being kept under wraps, but Somerset Council, which owns the land, is expected to use the proceeds to help plug its financial deficit.
Council leader Bill Revans said: ""We believe we got good value for the asset for the residents of Somerset.""
Paul Oster, one of the directors of Mayday Saxonvale, said the community ""won"" in the end.
""It's a bit unreal. I've spent four years imagining this moment in the distance and now here we are.
""I'm just delighted. We need to close the deal and then we're eager to get going.""
Somerset Council previously gave another rival developer, the Acorn Property Group, permission to buy the Saxonvale site in July last year.
The company pulled out the following day.
In a statement, Acorn said: ""Despite our best endeavours to work with all the stakeholders, the local community does not wish to work with Acorn"".
The council has since been in negotiations with Mayday Saxonvale. 
Mr Oster said they plan to deliver the ""biggest community-led development in the UK"".
This includes more than 260 homes, of which the group said at least 30% would be affordable.
There will also be employment space and community assets, which include a lido.
Any profits made from the scheme will go back into the community.
Mr Oster said that is what makes Mayday Saxonvale different from a traditional developer. 
He said: ""We are looking to engage the community and design the scheme around the needs of the community.""
Mr Revans said: ""Their proposals were exciting and innovative.
""They have convinced us that they have a business plan that will deliver for the people of Frome.
""It's not an easy site to develop and we look forward to seeing everything Mayday have planned to be enjoyed by residents here.""
Brigid Clarke, 63, a Frome resident, said she was ""so excited"" about the council's ""brilliant decision"".
She said: ""It's huge for Frome. I have grandchildren here and I'm excited to see the project.
""I hope it can be rolled out to other towns and other parts of the country.""
Mayday Saxonvale now has until the end of March to buy the site from Somerset Council.

Manfred Goldberg, now 94, was sent to the Riga ghetto in Latvia with his mother and younger brother.
He went on to be sent to five labour camps over the course of World War Two, including more than eight months in the Stutthof concentration camp and its subcamps – Stolp and Burggraben.
Mr Goldberg, who lives in London, has been sharing his experiences with children in Shropshire to ensure that people never forget what happened.
It comes as events to mark Holocaust Memorial Day are held across the West Midlands region.
This year, the annual memorial date will mark 80 years since the largest World War Two concentration camp, Auschwitz-Birkenau, was liberated on 27 January 1945.
In just over four-and-a-half years, Nazi Germany systematically murdered at least 1.1 million people at Auschwitz, built in the south of occupied Poland near the town of Oswiecim.
In a visit to a Newport school, Mr Goldberg told pupils: ""My purpose for coming here is because what happened must never be forgotten, in order to make sure it can never ever happen again.""
He described how his father had been able to escape to the UK days before World War Two broke out.
His younger brother Herman died in the camps, he said, while he and his mother survived and were reunited in 1946.
Mr Goldberg said: ""Once people understand what the Holocaust represents, I think every single one of them contributes to preventing it ever happening again.
""Silence never helps the oppressed.""
Tamworth Castle in Staffordshire will be lit up in purple as one of the memorial events taking place on Monday and a wreath will also be laid outside St Editha's Church in the town, in honour of victims of the Holocaust and other genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur.
The Royal British Legion will hold a ceremony outside the church at 11:00 GMT.
Council leader Carol Dean said the castle would be lit up in tribute to survivors and to take a stand against prejudice, discrimination and hatred.
She said: ""The Holocaust threatened the fabric of civilisation, and genocide must still be resisted every day.""
""Our world often feels fragile and vulnerable, and we cannot be complacent.
""Even in the UK, prejudice and the language of hatred must be challenged by us all.""
Services were held on Sunday by Redditch and Sandwell councils.
At the Sandwell event, Mindu Hornick spoke about her journey as an Auschwitz and Holocaust survivor.
Ms Hornick, from Birmingham, gives talks to young people about the horrors of the camps and has previously spoken to the BBC amid rising reports of antisemitic incidents in recent years.
Events in Worcester included an interfaith ceremony, poetry readings and a talk about the response of ordinary people to the radicalisation of the Nazis.
Telford & Wrekin Council is holding a special civic ceremony at AFC Telford on Monday and will be livestreaming it on Facebook. The event will include testimony from Mr Goldberg.
And Warwick's annual street service will take place by the war memorial, including readings by school children and a poem written by a King's High student on this year's theme - the fragility of freedom.
Several primary schools in the town are taking part in a special ceremony to learn about the Kindertransport - a mission that helped thousands of Jewish children to safety from Germany and Austria before the outbreak of war.
A service will also be held in Wolverhampton, organised by the city council and Interfaith Wolverhampton, at the city's art gallery.
People are being urged to take part in the remembrance by placing a lit candle in their window in the national Light the Darkness at 20:00.

283,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gwk7jqv3ko,2025-01-26,Weekly round-up: Five stories you may have missed,"A story about Peppa Pig World in Hampshire removing free entry for parents and carers of children with disabilities was among our most read this week.
We have picked five stories from the past seven days in Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Dorset, Berkshire and Oxfordshire to keep you up to date.
A 17th Century mourning ring discovered by a metal detectorist in Dorset is to go under the hammer.
Anthony Woolmington, who has been metal detecting for eight years, found the ring on a farm near Shillingstone in 2021.
Unaware of its significance, he handed it to the farmer, whose son began looking in to its origins.
Research by Dorset History Centre, British Museum and Hansons Auctioneers revealed the ring commemorated a death more than 300 years ago.
A mother-of-two whose water was temporarily cut off said Thames Water holds its customers in contempt after an MP's attempts to get compensation for her and others failed.
Steph Mitchell lives with her family in the Newtown area of Reading, Berkshire, and they lost their water supply for at least a day in January 2024.
She asked Reading Central MP Matt Rodda for help and his office has tried to get compensation but has been left frustrated.
A Thames Water apologised for January 2024's problems, which were caused by cold weather, and said customers' accounts were credited with compensation.
The mother of a boy with autism has told the BBC she is disappointed with the decision to remove free entry for parents and carers of children with disabilities at Peppa Pig World.
Paultons Park, which is home to the Peppa-themed rides, previously offered a free essential companion ticket alongside a full-priced ticket for any visitor requiring additional assistance.
The New Forest-based park has now rescinded this offer, and will instead charge carers 50% of the usual ticket price to enter the park.
A spokesperson for Paultons Park said the decision to bring in the change had been made ""under deep consideration"".
The family of a globe-trotting butler who mingled with royalty has been reunited with his lost postcards from the 1920s.
Frank Hills, who died in 1962, spent the majority of his life working as a valet, personal attendant or butler to affluent people.
In these roles he visited Egypt during the period King Tutankhamen's tomb was discovered, in 1922.
A series of eight postcards documenting his travels have been found at an antiques fair on the Isle of Wight and reunited with his family.
Twelve emergency vehicles destined for Ukraine have taken part in an ""unbelievable"" drive around an iconic race track.
Oxfordshire-based voluntary organisation Driving Ukraine has provided more than 150 vehicles for frontline efforts since the war began.
On Thursday, one of the biggest trips the group has organised will depart the UK for Ukraine, with 28 volunteers driving the 12 vehicles as well as £250,000 worth of aid to the western city of Lviv.
To mark the occasion, on Wednesday the 12 vehicles completed four laps of the Silverstone race track in Northamptonshire.

PC Lee Prince hit and mocked the 17-year-old boy outside Liquor World in Swindon, Wiltshire, while on-duty as a firearms officer on 17 April 2023.
He was found guilty of assault following a trial in March, where he was sentenced to 16 weeks' imprisonment suspended for 12 months.
Prince, who is currently suspended from his duties as a police officer, will also face an internal gross misconduct investigation.
At the trial, it was found that Prince used ""force to the face"" while detaining the boy outside a shop on suspicion of criminal damage.
The judge said the teenager was deemed ""vulnerable due to his age"" and because he had learning difficulties.
Prince was also verbally abusive to the boy and called him a ""cretin"".
Wiltshire Police Dep Ch Con Mark Cooper said: ""The public rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour from our officers, and where it is found that they have fallen short, it is right that they are held to account.
""We will not hesitate to robustly apply the law in such cases.
""The public place their trust and confidence in Wiltshire Police and it is imperative that we reflect that in how we expect the highest standards from those within the organisation.""
Prince must also complete 240 hours of unpaid work and was ordered to pay £775 in trial costs, £500 in compensation, and a £154 victim surcharge.

Extra sites for grit bins and grit drops have been called for after snow showers in January saw numerous incidents on the roads and complaints from residents.
Some people reported that existing grit bins across the district had been filled with litter, making them hard to use.
Brighton & Hove City Council has previously apologised for the ""difficulties""  people had to face.
In a motion due to go before the full council on Thursday, Green councillor Raphael Hill and Independent Mark Earthey said the council needed to do better, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
They added that gritting priority shouldn't just be given to main roads and bus routes, and asked for traffic light phasing at key junctions to be altered to deal with changing traffic patterns during snowfall.
The pair also want councillors to note the difficulty experienced by people walking on ungritted pavements and the effect of the changing climate, which is resulting in more extreme weather events.
In addition, their motion asks officers to seek resident feedback via a consultation about how the council dealt with the recent heavy snowfall.
Councillors are also asked to thank people in the community who came out to help others during the snow, particularly farmers who rescued trapped cars in Woodingdean.

286,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg49jz7v8no,2025-01-24,Trump revokes security protection for Covid adviser Fauci,"President Donald Trump has revoked security protection for former top US health official Anthony Fauci, who has faced death threats since leading the country's Covid-19 response. 
 ""You can't have a security detail for the rest of your life because you work for government,"" Trump told reporters, when asked about the decision on Friday. ""It's very standard."" 
This week, Trump also revoked security protections for his former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, his former National Security Adviser John Bolton and former  envoy Brian Hook, who all faced threats from Iran.  
Dr Fauci has now hired his own private security team that he will pay for himself, US media report.
Asked whether he felt responsible for the officials' safety, Trump said on Friday: ""They all made a lot of money. They can hire their own security too.""
Dr Fauci was previously protected by federal marshals, and then a private security company, which was paid for by the government, according to the New York Times. 
One of Dr Fauci's most vocal Republican critics, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, had called for his security to be revoked. 
He wrote in a post on X on Thursday that he had ""sent supporting information to end the 24 hr a day limo and security detail for Fauci"".  
""I wish him nothing but peace but he needs to pay for his own limos,"" he said. 
Trump has also revoked the security clearances of 51 intelligence officials who had claimed that Hunter Biden's laptop had ""all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.""
Under US protocol, former presidents and their spouses are granted security protection for life. But protection for other US officials is decided based on the threat assessment from the intelligence community.
As the former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Fauci faced death threats during and after the coronavirus pandemic, as well as criticism from Republicans over mask mandates and other Covid restrictions. 
He led the institute for 40 years, including during Trump's first term. Trump had also awarded presidential commendations to Dr Fauci who served on the Operation Warp Speed task force during the pandemic.
Before leaving office, then-President Joe Biden issued a preemptive pardon for Dr Fauci. 
The doctor told US media that he ""truly appreciated"" Biden for taking action, adding that the possibility of prosecution had created ""immeasurable and intolerable distress"" on his family.
""Let me be perfectly clear, I have committed no crime and there are no possible grounds for any allegation or threat of criminal investigation or prosecution of me,"" he said.

Work has started at St Ives Leisure Centre and Helston Sports Centre with £200,000 funding from Sport England.
It announced a further £175,448 for solar panels and pool covers at Liskeard Leisure Centre in December and work will start there in the next few months, operator GLL said.
James Curry, GLL's head of service for Cornwall said: ""The improvements at Liskeard alone will reduce our electricity costs by up to 35%, a very significant amount at a time when energy costs continue to remain high.""
Operating under the Better brand, GLL is the not-for-profit social enterprise that runs the centres on behalf of Cornwall Council.
Carol Mould, the council's portfolio holder for neighbourhoods, said: ""The installation of solar panels will significantly cut energy costs and reduce the carbon footprint of these centres.""
She said the council ""will continue to explore further funding opportunities to support Cornwall's leisure centres"".
The funding came from Sport England's £60m swimming pool support fund, made up of £40m government money and £20 million of lottery funding.

Strong wind gusts of up to 50-60mph that could leave buildings damaged and travel disruption was expected as the storm moves eastwards through Thursday, the Met Office said.
Weather warnings have been issued across Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Shropshire, and parts of Birmingham, Wolverhampton and the Black Country.
A yellow warning for wind comes into force across the region from midnight until 23:59 GMT on Friday.
The Met Office has warned people to expect damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs.
Public transport services, including buses and trains, were also likely to be affected alongside potential power cuts for homeowners.
Heavy rain on Friday morning may cause some local flooding, with a yellow warning for rain in place in Herefordshire and Shropshire from midnight on Friday until 09:00 GMT.
In Leominster, Herefordshire, a popular market that was due to take place in Etnam Street car park on Friday has been cancelled due to the weather.
""We thank you for your understanding and look forward to welcoming you to support our traders next week,"" a Leominster Town Council spokesperson said.
Elsewhere in the UK, red warnings have been issued for Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland on Friday as the storm arrives with severe gales.
The warnings for wind gusts mean flying debris could cause a danger to life, the Met Office said.
National Rail said severe weather may affect journeys until Saturday, with people advised to check their routes before travelling.
The storm may also affect West Midlands Railway services across their network on Friday, a spokesperson added.
Storm Eowyn - pronounced ""ay-oh-win"" - is the fifth named storm of the season.
It arrives weeks after Storm Darragh caused significant disruption and left a ""trail of carnage"", felling hundreds of trees along 500 miles of waterway in the region.
A man was taken to hospital in a critical condition after being trapped under a fallen tree in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, during the storm in December.

Evan Rothwell was hit by a grey Nissan Qashqai outside The King's School on Wrexham Road, Chester, on 12 November 2024 and died in hospital four days later.
Cheshire West and Chester Council said a review of road safety at the site was under way, with other measures including repairing street lights to be implemented ahead of its conclusion.
Head teacher, George Hartley said he welcomed the review of road safety but ""anything short of a reduction in the speed limit on this road will fall short of what is required to keep children safe"".
Mr Hartley said urgent action was needed ""not only for the safety of our children but also to address the growing concerns of the wider community"".
Cheshire Police have appealed for witnesses or anyone with information or CCTV footage of the incident to come forward.
A petition calling for the speed limit to be lowered and changes to be made to the junction outside the school, has reached over 14,000 signatures and also has the  backing of Evan Rothwell's family.
Mr Hartley added: ""We are yet to receive an adequate explanation as to why we are one of the only primary and secondary schools in the area to not have a 20 or 30mph speed limit outside our setting.""
Mr Hartley said he and Claire Taylor, owner of Jigsaw Nursery, also on Wrexham Road, had been raising concerns with the council since 2022.
""Action needs to be taken immediately to reduce the speed limit to prevent any further tragedies,"" said Mrs Taylor.
A Cheshire West and Chester Council spokesperson referred the BBC to their statement issued in December, in which they confirmed ""an independent and comprehensive review"" was to take place in January.
In this statement, the council also extended its condolences to Evan Rothwell's family and friends.

Guerrilla Gardening Reading started in 2016 when Caroline Fletch, a retired gardener, kept passing the promising piece of land.
Her husband Nick said the volunteers have now used plants to transform the little patch of grass on Vastern Road. 
And he said when the group went to maintain it, people would stop and tell them ""how much joy it brings"".
Speaking to BBC Radio Berkshire, Mr Fletch explained the name referred to ""doing things under the radar"". 
""It's finding a piece of land that you think could do with a bit of brightening up and just doing it unofficially, without too many people noticing it until it's done.""
He said the volunteers chose plants that were ""relatively low maintenance"" and ""can be fairly tolerant to not being watered"".
""We'd probably go there once a fortnight for an hour, there's four of us that tend to go and then we disappear,"" he said.
""We try and be unobtrusive, but whenever we go, people stop and say how much they like it, and how much joy it brings to them, which is really the whole purpose.""
Mr Fletch said he had noticed other efforts of guerrilla gardening in the area coming to fruition. 
He said: ""I would say to anyone walks past a piece of land that they think looks a bit dreary and... could do with something nice in it, then do it. 
""We are aware that guerrilla gardening is actually quite a thing... and I know it's something that happens in different countries of the world.""
The roots of the practice could be traced back to New York in the 1970s.

A contestant who was banished from the castle in Friday's episode of TV show The Traitors has said he has gone back to selling mobile phones.
Leon Jackman, from Ilkeston, in Derbyshire, appeared in the third series of the show, which has had many people gripped for the last few weeks.
The reality game show sees ""faithful"" contestants trying to work out who the ""traitors"" are in their midst. 
Mr Jackman said he has had a lot of attention at the mobile phone shop he works in since the show aired, but added: ""I'm still just a humble guy who normally sells mobile phones.""
He told the BBC that at work, people have been requesting video messages and asking who won, and one said they were surprised to see him still selling mobile phones.
Mr Jackman said: ""The weirdest one was when someone said 'you came across really well, amazing, but why are you still here?'
""I always said to my boss when I got on to the show... 'I am coming back to sell phones'.
""All I know is to make sure I have money to pay my mortgage and my family is fine.
""If an opportunity comes, that's a different scenario altogether, but I didn't come on to this gameshow thinking it would make me a superstar, but it's so nice for people to come and tell me that I am.""
Talking about the competition, he said: ""The game is so hard. There are no hard feelings with any of the cast – you've got to do what you've got to do.
""I try to be true to me.
""With some of the feedback I have had, I am glad that came across – that I was myself.
""But the game is stressful.""
He added he was happy he was a ""faithful"" because that was what his son wished for, and he wanted to do him proud.
""My youngest son is autistic, and that was the first programme he watched with me and my wife,"" he said.
""One day, he took his headphones off and got into the show. I thought 'this is amazing – we are watching something as a family'.
""I was happy because I was playing the role he wanted me to play.""

Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, were attacked by Axel Rudakubana at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the Merseyside town.
Eight other children and two adults – dance class leader Leanne Lucas and businessman Jonathan Hayes – were seriously wounded in the 29 July attack.
On Thursday Rudakubana was jailed for a minimum of 52 years at Liverpool Crown Court and told by the judge that he will more than likely die in prison. 
Jennifer Septhon, head of Farnborough Road Infants School, said it had been a ""real privilege to have known"" Elsie.
""From her nursery days being carried on Dad's shoulders into the playground, she was a girl with a super, beaming smile,"" said Ms Septhon. ""Someone who loved life, school and her friends.""
She described how Elsie loved ""performing, singing, dancing and being on stage"". 
Ms Septhon added: ""Elsie was adored by her friends and known by everyone in school due to the sparkle in her eyes, her infectious energy, caring nature and charismatic personality.
""It's difficult to put into words how amazing Elsie was and the impact she had on those around her.
""We miss you, Elsie. You were one of a kind.""
Natasha Sandland, head teacher of Marshside Primary, described Bebe as an ""amazing young lady full of giggles and love"".
She remembered how the little girl's ""beautiful toothless smile brightened up the darkest days"". 
""We grieve her loss every single day and will remember her with nothing but happy and fun memories,"" she said. 
""We will never associate her loss with this unthinkable act.""
Ms Sandland said the school's focus was on supporting Bebe's family and friends, as well as members of staff and the wider community. 
Alice's head teacher Jinne Payne, from Churchtown Primary School, described the nine-year-old as ""joy embodied"".
She said: ""To all the victims and their families and friends, we extend our deepest sympathy and unwavering support.

Tune Up, a programme run by Brighten the Corners in Ipswich, offers ten free weekly sessions for 16 to 25-year-olds that cover music production, programming, marketing and event management.
The participants will host a gig to mark Independent Venue Week (IVW), which runs from 27 January to 2 February and celebrates independent music and arts venues and the people that own, run and work in them.
Noah Wright, 17, one of the current participants, said: ""The gig scene in Ipswich is probably one of the best in East Anglia, it's something we should be really proud of.""
On 16 January in the House of Commons, Lisa Nandy, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, said: ""In Ipswich, an entire ecosystem is being created that equips young people with those skills and that love of music at school, and goes all the way through enabling them to perform at smaller and larger live music venues, and to get the skills that they need to work in the music industry. 
""We would like to replicate that model around the country.""
The number of small music venues in the UK declined by 13% in 2023 - accounting for as many as 30,000 fewer shows - according to the Music Venue Trust (MVT), which said the sector had taken a ""battering"".
MVT has been campaigning for £1 to be added to tickets for arena and stadium shows to subsidise the pubs and clubs where many headline acts start out.
In May a cross-party report, from the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, suggested a cut in VAT to help grass roots venues
Mr Wright added: ""There are downsides to Ipswich, there are downsides to every town, but what we've achieved here, and Tune Up is a small piece of that puzzle, it's truly impressive.""
Hux Josecelyne, 18, is another Tune Up participant and said he was surprised at how much work was involved in hosting a music event.
""We had to look through the budget side of things. Even for a gig at small grass roots venue you still have go through a formal process, contacting agents and finding artists,"" he said.
The event, organised by young people taking part in the Tune Up programme, will feature Sophie the Great, Arthur Black, HeadCheck and Helix at The Baths, Ipswich, on Friday 31 January.

Jack Stevens, 28, was driving his BMW along the A26 in Newhaven in May 2020 when a wood plank fell from a Travis Perkins lorry and went through his windscreen.
The father-of-three, from Burgess Hill, was described as ""kind and caring with a unique sense of humour"" by his parents.
Travis Perkins Trading Company Limited previously pleaded guilty to three offences under health and safety laws and was sentenced at Hove Crown Court on Thursday. 
Despite a corporate document about lorry safety stating ""we always properly secure loads before travel"" the timber was not banded together and was secured using only one ratchet strap.
The court heard how there had been several previous incidents where building materials had fallen from Travis Perkins lorries.
In April 2019, three steel bars hit another vehicle, while months earlier corrugated pipes ""blew off the back"" of a separate lorry.
Prosecution barrister Richard Heller accused the company of doing ""very little in response.""
Mr Stevens' parents have suffered ""extreme anxiety"" since his death.
Defence barrister Kate Brunner KC said the company takes ""full responsibility for the events that led to the death of Mr Stevens"". 
In a statement, Mr Stevens' parents said: ""Whilst today brings some justice for Jack, we will never forget our kind and dear son who we all miss so very much. Rest in peace Jack.""
Lewes District Council hopes its decision to bring a prosecution ""sends a strong message"" to businesses.
Deputy leader Christine Robinson said: ""While we welcome the substantial fine imposed today, it remains an absolute tragedy that Mr Stevens, a much-loved father-of-three, died in this entirely preventable case.""
Travis Perkins said it has ""cooperated fully"" and ""accepts the decision of the court"".
It said it has carried out an internal investigation and implemented ""enhanced"" training, adding: ""We strive to ensure an incident like this is never repeated.""

The food bank at Tow Law Community Centre, in County Durham, provides emergency food parcels and supplies to people facing difficult times, but now faces its own crisis.
While local people have donated in response to the appeal, volunteers say much more help is needed to enable the food bank to carry on.
Volunteer Fiona Nicol said: ""Previously the shelves were full, now they're bereft.""
She said the appeal was launched because last week, ""we literally had nothing, not even a tin of beans"".
Ms Nicol said it was the first time in her nine years of volunteering at the food bank it had been left completely empty.
She said the people who used the food bank were from a variety of backgrounds, including people with families and those who are in employment. 
""The cost of living crisis has cut across all [people],"" she said.
Ms Nicol said there had been a more than 40% increase in demand, with people using it who have never needed it before.
Describing the situation as ""frantic"", she said: ""Some days it's been that busy we couldn't even see the amount of people coming through the doors.""
While the bank was ""absolutely desperate"" for donations, it would not turn people away and volunteers would instead run to the shops to make sure they could provide food, Ms Nicol added.

296,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7d834ey4ro,2025-01-25,Thousands sign petition to save golf course,"More than 2,000 people have signed a petition to save a Leicestershire golf course threatened with closure.
Blaby District Council has proposed closing Enderby Golf Course as part of a plan to build 800 homes and an office park.
The authority runs the nine-hole site to the east of the village.
The petition, signed by 2,146 people and calls for the golf course not to be closed, will be discussed at a full council meeting on Tuesday.
Councillors will also discuss a separate petition, signed by 2,532 people, against the proposed inclusion of the golf course and nearby Carlton Park in the authority's new local plan - a strategy to find land for future development in the borough.
The petition against the site being included in the local plan states: ""This whole area has significant importance to local and non-local residents for both physical and mental wellbeing.  
""This accessible green space has been used and enjoyed by residents and non-residents for many decades, for recreational and leisure purposes.""
A new community called Hayes Gardens is proposed for the 141 acre (57 hectare) site, near Brockington College.
Most of the proposed development site is owned by Santander UK, the authority said.
The banking firm said it had consolidated buildings on its Carlton Park office complex, leaving surplus land for potential housing.
Council leader Terry Richardson said: ""We are always pleased to see our communities engaged in what we're doing as a council and our plans for growth to support our expanding population. 
""We know there are some strong feelings behind the petitions and understand there is a lot of interest in attending the meeting.""
Richardson said no decisions on the developments would be made at the meeting but the petitions would be referred to council departments after they were debated.
The council said it expected to launch a public consultation on its new local plan in the summer.

Sarah Stanford routinely walks six dogs at a time, but imminent changes for the Great Park and two other Crown Estate forests in Berkshire mean a person can only walk four.
The Crown Estate said well-behaved dogs are welcome and the new measures, set after a consultation, would ""allow everyone to continue to enjoy the space safety and responsibly"".
Most of the changes will be introduced from 25 February.
They also include Swinley and Buttersteep Forests, as well as banning dog walkers being in groups of more than eight dogs.
All professional dog walkers must also have a professional dog walking permit from 31 March.
""I would only take six because I am only insured for six,"" Mrs Stanford said. 
""What we cannot understand is where the Crown Estate has got to this rather arbitrary figure of four, which frankly will put some of us out of business – or we will just have to put prices up.
""An hour's long dog walk, which is what most clients pay for, is not an hour's walk. It's two hours by the time you've got the six dogs.""
Annually about 5.5m people visit Windsor Great Park, with about 2m visiting Swinley and Buttersteep Forests. 
The Crown Estate said it hoped its plans would ""ensure that all visitors, including dogs, have a safe and enjoyable visit and help to safeguard vital habitats and rare flora and fauna on the Windsor Estate"".
In a statement, a Crown Estate spokesperson added: ""The [professional] permit will ensure that all professional dog walkers are compliant with health and safety standards for their dogs and staff, that they are fully insured, that their customers are protected while their dogs are walked in Windsor Great Park and Forest, and that our other visitors are comfortable.
""While we are supportive of local businesses, we must prioritise the safety and security of our visitors to Windsor Great Park, and protect both the environment and local wildlife.""

298,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyp548gj8vo,2025-01-25,Streeting accuses Farage of 'miserabilist' vision for UK,"The health secretary has accused Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of having a ""miserablist, declinist"" vision of the UK, in the most direct attack yet by a senior Labour figure. 
Wes Streeting made the comments in a speech on Saturday at the Fabian Society, a left-leaning organisation, warning of the need to take the ""populist right"" seriously. 
He accused Farage of not believing in a universal health service ""free at the point of use"", and of having a ""poverty of ambition"" for the UK that Labour ""utterly rejects"". 
Farage responded by saying it was Labour who had the miserable vision and that Reform was the ""optimistic alternative"". 
""The crux of Farage's argument is this: what was possible in the 20th Century isn't possible in the 21st,"" Streeting told his audience. 
""People shouldn't have to choose between a health service that treats them on time and an NHS free at the point of use.""
Nigel Farage has previously suggested that the NHS could be replaced by an insurance-based system. However, Reform policy documents say healthcare should always remain free at the point of delivery.
""The populist right are coming for us and we need to be serious about beating them,"" Streeting said, adding that Farage could be defeated by ""turning around the NHS"". 
The health secretary spoke of meeting people every day on the campaign trail ""who had been let down by the NHS"", being made to wait for ambulances or operations. 
Some voters had ""the most appalling experiences, and because of how they've been treated, they were voting for Reform"", he said.
Farage wrote on social media following the speech that Streeting ""is so scared of Reform that he has now resorted to lying about our plans for the NHS"".
""Let me be clear, the NHS will always be free at the point of delivery under a Reform government,"" he added.
Farage has said that his ultimate goal is to win the next general election, building on the momentum that Reform has recently enjoyed. 
While his party has largely been viewed as a threat to the Conservatives, in recent weeks it has been gaining ground on both Labour and the Tories in opinion polls.
One recent YouGov poll, which asked people who would make the best prime minister, suggested similar levels of support for both Nigel Farage and Sir Keir Starmer.
Shortly after Streeting began his speech in the historic Guildhall in central London, a climate protester climbed onto her chair and began heckling him. 
""When we voted for Labour, we voted for change,"" the demonstrator shouted. ""But your government continues to subsidise the Drax power station.""
The North Yorkshire wood-burning power station receives large government subsidies - but has been accused of using wood from unsustainable sources and was fined last year after Ofgem found it had given the watchdog inaccurate data on the type of material it used.
Streeting did not halt his speech, and the woman was ushered from the hall as she continued to warn about ""climate breakdown"". 
Almost immediately, a second woman stood up and began shouting. She too was led out.
The interruptions prompted the health secretary to deviate from his prepared remarks, saying he was ""in politics to make real change, not shout from the sidelines"". The audience then applauded. 
He later joked that he was surprised there were not more protesters.

299,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yd78nng95o,2025-01-25,The Papers: Job cut fears and PM 'rejects whole-life term reform',"A variety of stories lead Saturday's papers.
The Guardian says it could take police years to retrieve the internet search history of the Southport killer, Axel Rudakubana. The paper says officers are locked in a lengthy legal process to get the data from Google and Microsoft because the teenager deleted the browsing history on his devices before carrying out the attack. The Guardian says the information could provide vital clues about why he targeted a group of children. Google says it is supporting police with their inquiries, while Microsoft has declined to comment.
The Daily Telegraph says Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been accused of ""hiding behind the UN"" after he refused to extend whole-life prison sentences to teenage murderers like Rudakubana. Downing Street says it is bound by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The former Conservative justice secretary, Sir Robert Buckland, tells the paper that those rules are not binding and have not been incorporated into UK law.
Chancellor Rachel Reeves has talked up the economy in an interview with the Times. She tells the paper there could be as many as six interest rate cuts by the middle of next year and that the UK could do with a dose of US President Donald Trump's ""optimism"". She also says there are good reasons why Britain could avoid the tariffs Trump is threatening to impose. Reeves says the president is ""worried about countries that have large and persistent trade surpluses with the US"" and that that's not the case for the UK.
The weekend edition of the i says the government is being warned that it will have to open up the NHS to private companies if it wants a trade deal with Trump. The paper says US drugs firms want the UK medicines watchdog to relax its rules on prices. The article says government sources insist access to the NHS would be a red line in trade talks.
A couple of the front pages highlight studies that paint a gloomy picture of the UK economy. The Daily Mail's focuses on one that warns thousands of companies are struggling to survive, while the Financial Times leads on a separate report that suggests the pace at which firms are cutting staff has surged.
Many papers have photos of the destruction left by Storm Éowyn. The Sun has images of huge waves at Porthcawl in south Wales and a car that has been crushed by a falling brick wall in Sunderland. The Daily Express pictures an overturned lorry blocking a road in County Durham and houses in Northumberland covered in building materials blown from a nearby construction site.
The Daily Mirror says a lock of Sir Paul McCartney's hair is being sold for more than £20,000. The paper says it was snipped from the singer's head during the peak of Beatlemania 60 years ago. The fan who cut the lock says she grabbed Sir Paul's hair as he left a studio in London. She says while it ""sounds dreadful now"" it was a ""normal thing to do"" back then.

300,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvge85nmkero,2025-01-26,Police contacted over school rugby tour,"Methodist College Belfast says it took disciplinary action and contacted the police after a complaint about incidents on a school rugby trip to Portugal.
A former pupil at the school was last week awarded more than £50,000 in a civil case in the wake of the training camp.
The family of Gabriel McConkey, now 19, say he was left ""traumatised"" after ""degrading"" videos were recorded of him on the trip in December 2022.
He was in lower sixth when it is alleged that older pupils forced him and others to run naked around the resort they were staying in.
It is his case that they then used the video to coerce him into having his head shaved.
It is also his case that he was forced to witness other boys as they were coerced into performing an act on a sex toy.
BBC News NI asked Methodist College a number of questions about what happened.
The school confirmed police had been contacted in the wake of the tour but did not say whether it was the authorities in Northern Ireland or Portugal.
The school said disciplinary action had been taken but did not elaborate on the details.
A spokesperson for Methodist College said: ""A claim for compensation was brought by Mr McConkey and was settled with the school's insurers.
""The fact that these incidents occurred during downtime following training sessions and during sleeping hours has caused the school to review and improve its supervision procedures.
""Updated supervision procedures have been in place in the two years since these incidents occurred, and to the school's knowledge, there has been no recurrence of any such incidents.""
The person in charge of the 2022 trip is still involved in rugby at the school.
Methodist College says pastoral support was made available during and after the trip.
The statement sent to BBC News NI did not contain an apology to Mr McConkey, who was 17 at the time of the incidents.
A social media account which publishes details about the school's rugby matches last week used the slogan ""For he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.""
Asked if this was appropriate, the spokesperson said: ""No. The post has been deleted.""
After the civil case was settled on Wednesday, Mr McConkey's mother, Sian Mawhinney, told BBC News NI that her son was ""absolutely broken"" when he returned from the trip in December 2022.
""Gabriel came back from this trip a totally different child than the one that we sent away, and I think no mother expects these events to take place on a school trip,"" she said.
""They expect their children to be looked after and to be supervised, and obviously something went terribly wrong,"" she added.
""He was traumatised by it.""
She said she was ""incredibly proud"" of her son.
""He is an amazing person because he has a really strong sense of justice,"" she said.
In a statement, Ulster Rugby, which runs the annual Schools' Cup competition, said it acknowledged the settlement made.
""What is reported does not align with the values of rugby, or the behaviours we expect from those involved in the game,"" it added.
""This is an issue for Methodist College Belfast, but we will be engaging with the school to ensure we promote rugby as an inclusive and enjoyable game for all.""

The 14-acre (5.7-hectare) site, next to Severn View Services, in South Gloucestershire, is set to be the first permanent home of the charity Gympanzees, which works to create exercise and play facilities for disabled children and young people.
The facility is expected to open in 2026 but the charity still needs to raise the second half of their £8m target to complete all necessary renovations.
Karina Kay, whose son Joel uses the service, said she was amazed by the ""big"" and ""spacious"" new space.
""It's a good support network Joel can come along to and then I can meet other parents who use the service,"" she said.
""Having somewhere that is a permanent location to come to any day of the week, not just in the holidays, will be such a good opportunity for him to have a safe space with everything that he needs,"" she said.
""It will be amazing for Joel, it's such a big and spacious place.
""It will really help him mobilise and will be really fun at the same time.""
Gympanzees have been operating through pop-up events in temporary homes around Bristol since 2018 and have attracted tens of thousands of attendees.
""People are travelling from around the country to come to us, and they're staying in hotels,"" said Stephanie Wheen, founder of Gympanzees.
""The need is absolutely massive, and the feedback we get is immense."" 
The facility will include a trampoline room, soft play and sensory rooms among others.
Cutting edge equipment is being brought in to ensure that everything in the new space is as inclusive as it can possibly be, Ms Wheen said.
""We have things like the inner walk, which is a cross trainer for our most physically disabled children.
""It can be the first time that they have been out of breath in their whole lives and the first time they've ever had exercise,"" she added.

In a letter to X, Meta, TikTok, Google, and YouTube, Yvette Cooper said the ease of access to such content, including an al-Qaeda training manual, was ""unacceptable"" and that the firms had a ""moral responsibility to act"".
Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that online platforms must act now.
Axel Rudakubana was last week jailed for 52 years after pleading guilty to murdering Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, 9, at a dance class in July. 
As well as the three killings, Rudakubana pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of eight other children and two adults injured in the attack. 
Searches of his home uncovered material which suggested an obsession with violence, including the academic study of an al-Qaeda training manual downloaded from the internet.
Police have said Rudakubana used techniques set out in the manual when he carried out the attack. 
Reeves told the BBC that it was ""totally unacceptable"" that he ""was able to access - really easily - such hateful material"", adding that online platforms ""have a moral responsibility to take that content down and make it harder for people to access it"".
She said that the government's online safety bill, which becomes law in March, can order the removal of violent and hateful material. 
""But there is nothing stopping the companies taking down that material now. They've got a moral responsibility to do so.""
In the home secretary's letter, which was co-written with Technology Secretary Peter Kyle, Cooper said that, while possession of the document was illegal under existing anti-terror laws, Rudakubana had been ""able to easily obtain access"" to it and that it ""continues to remain available online"".
""The ease of access to such dangerous, illegal content is unacceptable,"" she said. 
""We must prevent further unlawful access to instructional material by those wishing to do harm to the United Kingdom.""
Before leaving home to carry out the attack, Rudakubana watched graphic footage of a knife attack on Australian bishop Mari Emmanuel that had taken place a few months earlier.
Cooper noted the video of the attack had been removed in Australia but could still be accessed in the UK, adding the Southport attack had ""laid bare the potential consequences of failing to act on such content"".
""We are therefore urgently asking you to ensure this is also removed from your platforms to ensure that it is not used to inspire other attacks,"" she said.
From March, under the Online Safety Act, which passed in October, social media platforms will be obliged to to take ""proportionate measures"" to protect users from illegal content. 
Cooper said there was ""no justification for waiting for laws to kick in"" and that platforms had a ""moral responsibility to act now"".
All five companies have been approached for comment. 
The government has announced that a public inquiry will take place into the opportunities to stop Rudakubana that were missed. 
Rudakubana was referred to the Prevent programme on three separate occasions between 2019 and 2021.
He also had a prior conviction for a violent offence against another child at school and admitted to carrying a knife more than 10 times.
The Sunday Times reports that a Home Office review due to be released in redacted form has identified ""serious failings"" in the way Rudakubana was handled by counter-terrorism officers.
The paper says officers believed Rudakubana had only a general interest in world news and current affairs, instead of any particular cause or political belief, and so was not thought to be in danger of being radicalised.

Harry Jones, 18, from Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, travelled to Buckingham Palace to meet Prince Edward and accept the The Duke of Edinburgh's Award (DofE) This is Youth prize.
After completing his Bronze, Silver and Gold DofE awards, he became a young leader, and motived more groups to complete their top award, with some saying they could not have done it without his support. 
He said taking part in the scheme has changed him for the better, and he is now more ""steadfast, confident and open"". 
Harry started his first DofE Bronze award at the age of 14 while at Chiltern Way Academy – a special educational needs school near Aylesbury.
It involved taking part in expeditions, volunteering at a primary school and taking part in litter picks.
He said he struggled with his speaking and listening abilities but credited the awards scheme for his improvement.
""I'm more decisive in my decision making, I'm more bolder in the challenges I want to undertake and I think I'm far more sociable,"" he said.
""I've become more steadfast - when I come to a decision that I think is right, I will stand by it, I've become more confident, I've become more willing to do new things and I have become more open.""
This is Youth Trailblazer of the Year judge, Jason Fox, a former Royal Marine Commando and star of SAS: Who Dares Wins, said Harry's ""remarkable strength and perseverance"" stood out.
""Harry went from being a very shy young lad who felt uncomfortable interacting with his fellow pupils, to being an inspirational leader, selfless in supporting them to overcome their own challenges,"" he said.
Matt Rush, DofE leader at Chiltern Way Academy, said: ""Harry leads by example and has an excellent calming manner.""
He would ""do anything to help others, even if it's uncomfortable for himself"", he added.
""Harry has his own complex needs and finds social situations challenging, but it shows just how much the DofE has helped him.""
Harry has since left school and is studying a two-year course in public services at the Buckinghamshire College Group's Aylesbury campus and hopes to work in the uniformed services like the fire or ambulance service. 
Harry's advice to other young people wanting to take part in the scheme is: ""Your limit and your line is wherever you set it.
""Go as far as you think you can go and push, you can go further if you have the right group and the right mindset.""

306,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8jz6ymeq8o,2025-01-26,Why is Peterborough United looking at a rebrand?,"Peterborough United are looking at a ""brand evolution"" that could mean changes to their 2008-designed crest. Following in the footsteps of Cambridge United, Norwich City and countless others, Posh wants to sharpen their look for the digital age and hear from supporters. But would fans prefer to focus on football, not fonts?
The crest, created in 2008, is based on the city's coat of arms, which features cross keys and the motto ""upon this rock"".
Both originate from the Bible and the story of St Peter, on whom the name of Peterborough is based. 
It also features a towered crown, believed to represent the city's walls, and the date the club was founded. The eagle wings and lions relate to gentry associated with Peterborough. 
The coat of arms itself is not exclusive to the club, of course. It's found on taxi firms, rowing and hockey clubs, and a troupe of Morris dancers use a similar design.
The coat of arms may well represent the city of Peterborough, but it's quite busy - and busy isn't a look brands are going for in 2025.
""The name of the game is to be instantly recognisable,"" explained Ben Stevenson, Peterborough United commentator for BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.
""The marketplace is incredibly crowded - there are 92 clubs in the top divisions, and every single one of them is doing the same thing.
""They are all trying to attract new fans, advertising and want to stand out.""
Clive Edwards, head of media and marketing at Peterborough United, said it had to consider how the crest was used - across the kit, on social media, and on ""sub-brands"" that did not exist in 2008.
They include the Posh+ streaming service and Posh Rewards loyalty scheme, with other revenue streams likely to follow, Mr Edwards added.
""The challenges with the complexities of the existing crest lead us to believe there are areas where we can improve,"" he added.
Matt Walker, a lifelong Posh fan and self-confessed ""traditionalist"", said he believed the crest should be the coat of arms of the city, with the cross keys and motto retained.
""Everything nowadays has to be aimed for the digital market - clean lines, sans serif fonts and minimalist designs,"" added Mr Walker, who works in design.
""The problem with this is it's a football crest and not a company logo. 
""It still needs to look good on letterheads and club blazers.""
Toby Wood, vice chair of the city's civic society, said the club should be careful not to do anything ""too bland"" or too far removed from the current crest.
""It is distinctive and it fits in with the element of being Posh - slightly upmarket and rather grand,"" he added.
Tattooist Hayley Mears has inked the crest for customers at her studio at Orton Goldhay. 
""I do think it needs to stick to some of the original design,"" she said.
""I've seen some of the clubs locally that have done this and they [the redesigns] don't have any character in them. 
""It loses itself and becomes a marketing thing.""
Norwich City freshened up its Canary crest for the 2022-23 season and Cambridge United are due to launch their redesigned look next season.
Last year, Northampton Saints' simplified crest was hailed by some as clear and easily recognisable, while others complained it was like a last-minute effort for a school project.
Designer Chris Payne, who put forward three ideas for Cambridge United, including their new book and ball crest, has been drafted in to work his magic for Peterborough.
""He's incredibly experienced at this - he's done this for loads of clubs, some non-league and some in the US,"" said Ben Stevenson.
For now, the club is starting a consultation about the possibility of a rebranding and is keen to hear from anyone with an interest in the club.
The 18-month process starts with a fan survey.
""At the moment we are in the research and listening phase,"" added Mr Edwards.
""It's really important to hear how fans feel about the existing crest.""
Events connected with the rebrand are expected to be announced later.
If a redesign is agreed, a final sign-off would happen in October, with the branding rolled out in time for the 2026-27 season.

Freddie was welcomed to his new home at Shepreth Wildlife Park, Cambridgeshire, after the closure of the Cat Survival Trust in Hertfordshire.
The lynx was one of 28 animals rescued after the prosecution of the trust's owner, Terrence Moore, who was found guilty of animal welfare offences last year. 
Rebecca Willers, the director of Shepreth Wildlife Park, said: ""This rescue mission shows how wildlife parks and local authorities can work together to give rescued animals like Freddie a second chance.""
Teams at Hertfordshire Zoo and its sister site The Big Cat Sanctuary in Ashford, Kent, cared for 28 rescued cats after the closure of the Cat Survival Trust.
Moore, the former director of the trust, was found guilty last May of four charges of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.
At St Albans Crown Court he was told to rehome the animals ahead of being banned from keeping them.
The Sun reported he was attacked by one of the cats in November.
On Thursday, a team from Shepreth Wildlife Park travelled to Hertfordshire to collect Freddie and introduce him to his new habitat.
Ms Willers said: ""When we were first contacted about this rescue, we knew we had to help if we could. 
""It is hard when you have limited resources available, however having cared for lynx previously for nearly two decades we knew we could recreate the perfect environment to meet all of his needs. 
""Freddie's welfare at Shepreth will be a priority. He will receive expert veterinary care, a carefully managed diet appropriate for his species and ongoing enrichment to promote his physical and mental wellbeing.""
The lynx will be screened to join a breeding programme aimed at conserving the species. 
Dean Ward, the co-curator of Shepreth Wildlife Park, said he was excited to welcome lynx back to Shepreth and to be able to educate visitors about the cats which once roamed the UK hundreds of years ago. 
""We will be able to work closely with Freddie building up a good relationship through enrichment and training, and I know he will be a firm favourite of the keepers and our visitors to the park,"" he said.

308,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr0qkdwkl9o,2025-01-26,New charity boosting confidence through cycling,"A new charity is aiming to boost confidence in adults with neurological or physical disabilities through the power of cycling. 
David George, 60, is the honorary chair and trustee of Bike Active North Suffolk (BANS) based in Halesworth.
After noticing a gap within adult disability cycling and finding a love for volunteering, Mr George set up the charity last year and is now looking to expand the sessions.
A recent fundraiser saw Suffolk-born Paralympian and swimmer Will Ellard kick-off the event, which was described as ""inspiring"".
After retiring, Mr George found a love for volunteering in 2018.
He volunteered with national accessible cycling charity Wheels for All at sessions for disability groups in Norwich, before he was approached with an idea of setting something similar up in north Suffolk.
He saw how much people in Norwich loved the group and the benefits it had for both them and their carers.
Preparations for BANS got under way in February last year and by July it had its first general meeting and the trustees were appointed.
Six months later, Mr George has been able to get some individual clients involved, as well as groups in Halesworth, for some sessions.
""What you can see when you do these session is that the clients absolutely love it,"" Mr George explained.
""In Halesworth we have chosen a route which is part of the national Sustrans route one, which passes through the really lovely Halesworth Millennium Green.
""It's vehicle free so all they encounter is other cyclists, dog walkers and pedestrians.
""It's all about social interaction as well, so the clients can talk amongst themselves and to the volunteers.""
Safety is a key part with routes being tested and carers, as well as volunteers, staying with clients during the sessions.
As well as aiming to recruit more volunteers, the charity is fundraising for equipment.
Snap Gym in Beccles recently hosted the charity's 500-mile sponsored spin bike challenge over 24 hours.
Swimmer Ellard, who is from the town, started the event, which Mr George said was ""inspiring"".
""Personally I was a bit gutted because I had a bad back so I couldn't cycle, but the volunteers and mainly the gym members... sailed through the target and cycled about 558 miles,"" he said.
""Everyone had a lot of fun... we smashed the target and we had some really good banter.""
Mr George previously cycled from Land's End to John O'Groats where he raised £1,400 for the charity, which he said was an ""incredible"" achievement for himself.
By spring, Mr George hoped the charity would be doing regular fortnightly sessions for clients and he hoped to expand to other areas within north Suffolk.
""We're getting toward the fun bit and that is delivering to clients,"" he said.
""There's nothing that can beat the feedback and the expression that you can get from clients on the day and the carers.""

309,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3605g34jx5o,2025-01-23,Judge blocks Trump's plan to end US birthright citizenship,"A federal judge in Seattle has temporarily blocked Donald Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship in the US. 
US District Court Judge John Coughenour called Trump's executive order ""blatantly unconstitutional"" and issued a restraining order blocking it from going into force after a 25-minute hearing on Thursday.
Under a long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, nearly anyone born inside the US is automatically given citizenship.
Trump hopes to end that rule for children born to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily.
Four states - Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon - asked for the order to be paused while the federal court considers the states' legal challenge.
During arguments, Judge Coughenour asked a lawyer for the Trump administration ""where were the lawyers"" when the executive order was drafted by Trump's team, and chastised him for his claim that the order is constitutional.
""It boggles my mind,"" the judge said.
The executive order will be put on hold for 14 days pending further legal proceedings.
Trump, who has issued a range of unilateral actions since returning to the US presidency on Monday, has long vowed to make this particular change. 
His executive order called on US government departments and agencies to deny the granting of citizenship to the children of migrants who are either in the US illegally or on temporary visas.
It would have applied to children born on 19 February and onwards, according to legal filings in the case by the Department of Justice (DoJ).
There have been reports that the administration was planning to enforce the order by withholding documents, such as passports, from people it deems ineligible for citizenship.
The judge's order also put a temporary stop to any enforcement of the order by federal agencies.
In their lawsuit, the four states challenging the order argue that the 14th Amendment and US law ""automatically confer citizenship upon individuals born in the United States"" and that the president does not have the power to amend the Constitution.
They add that if the order is implemented, residents of those states will ""suffer immediate and irreparable harm"".
""The individuals who are stripped of their United States citizenship will be rendered undocumented, subject to removal or detention, and many will be stateless,"" the lawsuit states.
Trump's Department of Justice argued that the case brought by the states does not warrant the ""extraordinary measure"" of a temporary restraining order, but the judge disagreed. 
The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, states in part: ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States"".
The DoJ argued that the clause ""and subject to the jurisdiction thereof"", excludes children of non-citizens who are in the US unlawfully, and added that the order is ""an integral part"" of Trump's goal to address the country's ""broken immigration system and the ongoing crisis at the southern border"".
There were 255,000 children born to undocumented mothers in the US in 2022, according to the states' legal challenge.
The amendment has been interpreted by courts as granting citizenship to anyone born on US territory, with very limited exceptions such as the children of foreign diplomats.
Without a direct amendment to the US Constitution - which requires a two-thirds vote in both chambers of Congress, plus the approval by America's states - experts say the issue is likely to be ultimately decided by the courts.
Lawyers for the federal government said they planned to appeal the ruling, and that they expected the case to end up in front of the US Supreme Court.
The birthright citizenship amendment dates back to the days after the US Civil War, and settled the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves.
Lane Polozola, a lawyer for Washington state, argued in court that Trump's order would bring the nation back ""to one of our... darkest chapters"".
Judge Coughenour, who paused the executive order, has served in the Western District of Washington court since 1981 after he was appointed by then-president Ronald Reagan, a Republican.
A group of 18 other Democratic-led states, along with the District of Columbia and the city of San Francisco, have filed a separate challenge to the executive order.
Trump's order is also facing a legal challenge from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).

Post offices in Kendal and Barrow were among 115 across the UK announced in November as being at risk of being axed.
Westmorland and Furness Councillor Eamonn Hennessy noted that half of Barrow's banks had also closed since 2015, while ""similar challenges"" were being faced in Kendal.
The council approved a motion calling on Post Office Ltd to pause its plans to close what the local authority described as ""important, vital community hubs"". 
At Thursday's council meeting, Dyan Jones brought forward the motion to instruct the council's chief executive to write to Post Office bosses.
Her motion said the council was ""disappointed"" by Post Office Ltd's plans, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. 
""Crown Post Offices, in Kendal and Barrow-in-Furness, provide important, vital community hubs and many local residents rely on their services,"" it read. 
""For Post Office Ltd to announce the threat of closure without consultation with these local communities is of concern to us as councillors elected to represent them.""
Mr Hennessy said the move posed a ""significant threat to residents particularly in the light of the ongoing loss of high street banks in both areas"".
Councillor Anne Burns added that the Barrow post office could ""become a real hub if it just put its mind to actually thinking what other services could go in to there"".
The Post Office is looking at options for its wholly owned branches, which currently employ about 1,000 workers and are loss-making.
These could include alternative franchise arrangements.
The company said it would ""review all responses, sharing the results with relevant trade unions and other stakeholders"".
Since the announcement, thousands have signed a petition against plans to close Kendal's Post Office.
Liberal Democrat Westmorland and Lonsdale MP Tim Farron, who launched the petition, previously said he was ""deeply alarmed"" by the closure threat.

Calogero Ricotta, 64, is accused of killing his wife Maria, 54, and her 29-year-old son Giuseppe Morreale in the family home in the village of Ugley in Essex on 28 May.
Mr Ricotta denies the murders and causing actual bodily harm (ABH) to a youth who was present in the house.
Simon Spence KC, prosecuting, told Chelmsford Crown Court: ""Background to the murders was an increasingly unhappy marriage between the defendant and his wife, leading her to take steps to try and get a divorce and seek to get some financial independence from him.""
Mr Spence said these were ""things we say the defendant didn't want to happen and which he tried to prevent"".
""Both Maria and Giuseppe, known as Joe, were stabbed several times with a kitchen knife and both of them had their throats cut in a manner we suggest were attacks that caused very similar injuries to both victims,"" he said.
A pathologist's report revealed Mrs Ricotta - whose maiden name was Nugara - sustained a total of 14 stab wounds and 44 further cuts.
The incident took place in the lounge of the family home, known as Woodlands, in the evening, said Mr Spence.
He continued: ""An increasing tension and unhappiness are what led to the horrific events on 28 May.""
Mr Spence said that in a Whatsapp message to a friend the day before the attacks, Mrs Ricotta said she was ""a bit scared"", adding: ""He's saying I have to stay with him or things are going to get messy.""
The defendant and his wife occupied separate bedrooms in the house at the time, the court heard.
Mr Spence told the trial that at Christmas, the defendant was heard to say of his wife: ""If she doesn't listen to me, I will cut her throat like a sheep and put her in a hole.""
A woman, who was also present in the house on 28 May, said Mrs Ricotta ""had been to see the solicitor about being divorced"".
The trial was told that on the day of the stabbings, Mrs Ricotta had gone to visit one of her daughters and arrived back home at 21:47 GMT.
Mr Spence said Mr Ricotta attacked his wife after she was captured on CCTV arriving back at the house.
A youth, who was present in the house, said the defendant had come into the kitchen and said to Mrs Ricotta: ""I want to talk to you"" - but she was frightened.
They said the couple went into the living room and 10 seconds later, he heard her screaming for help.
He described seeing Mrs Ricotta pinned against the sofa in the lounge with Mr Ricotta ""just stabbing her"".
Mr Morreale had run in and jumped on the defendant before he was stabbed in the stomach, the court heard.
The youth said he did not realise he had been stabbed in the hand until later. He said he kicked Mr Ricotta in the face and ran from the room. 
He told police: ""There was blood everywhere"". 
Another person who was present in the house called the police at 21.50, Mr Spence said, about two minutes and 45 seconds after Mrs Ricotta arrived home.
The trial continues.

Portsmouth Deaf Club holds meetings in the city, at a centre owned by the Portsmouth Deaf Association, but the charity has said it is no longer viable to keep it open.
Brenda Maynard, 83, from Portchester, is one of about 50 members who attend the club to play cards, drink coffee and catch up.
The association said it was liaising with the club as it looked for other premises to keep it going.
The club began in 1934 and has held regular get-togethers at the deaf centre in Arundel Street since 1984. 
Ms Maynard is profoundly deaf and uses British Sign Language (BSL) to communicate.
She has been a member since she was seven, and said ""all my favourite people are here"". 
Another member, Debbie Hawkins, from Cosham, married her husband Steve at the centre and said the club was a lifeline for people with hearing loss.
""This community is very important. We have good relationships and care about each other,"" she said.
""It's a place where we can have conversations. 
""Outside there are always barriers for deaf people. But not in here.""
Anthony Miller, from Emsworth, a club member of 50 years, has been going to the club since he was 13 years old.
He said: ""I worry about the future of the club if it closes. Where are my grandsons going to go?""
Chair of Portsmouth Deaf Association David Jackson said as the number of deaf people using the centre continued to diminish, ""its usage is now becoming limited"".
""Sadly, these duties have resulted in the trustees having some very difficult discussions to make about the future of this charity and have come to a painful decision to close the Deaf Centre on [1February].""
The club members said it was ""not just about cups of tea"".
They also campaigned for years for BSL to gain formal legal recognition.
A fight they won after MPs backed the proposal and some of the club members travelled to Trafalgar Square in March 2022 to celebrate the new legislation.

314,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qjy4lzqn3o,2025-01-26,Huge crowds await return to north Gaza after delays,"An agreement to release Israeli hostage Arbel Yehud has been reached that would allow people to return to north Gaza, a senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad official has told the BBC, after a dispute over her release caused a delay.
The source said she would be freed on Friday in exchange for the release of 30 Palestinian prisoners serving long-term and life sentences.
The deal would pave the way for thousands to go to north Gaza on Sunday night or Monday morning.
Israel has not yet confirmed if a deal has been reached.
On Saturday, Hamas freed four Israeli female soldiers held hostage since 7 October 2023 in return for 200 Palestinian prisoners. Ms Yehud, a civilian, was set to be freed first.
Israel accused Hamas of breaching its ceasefire agreement and said it would continue to block the route to northern Gaza because she was not released.
Thousands of displaced Palestinians attempting to reach northern Gaza gathered at the military barrier blocking their progress. 
Images showed massive crowds waiting to pass the Netzarim Corridor, a road which separates north and south Gaza and is controlled by Israeli troops.
Nirmeen Musabeh, 42, travelled from Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, but was displaced from her home in Shejaiya, in the south. 
""We're sleeping in the streets,"" she told the BBC at the checkpoint.
""We can't go home and every time we try to go home they shoot at us.""
Diab Shehbari said on Sunday that she had been at the checkpoint since 20:30 local time (18:30 GMT) on Saturday.
""We slept here. All night the kids were screaming because of the cold - we lit a fire and covered them,"" he said.
He wants to return to Jabalia to see his sons and bury the dead.
""I expect to see destruction,"" he said.
""People are saying that with the level of destruction, there are no landmarks remaining. I want to see this with my own eyes.""
There were some chaotic scenes on Saturday evening as Palestinians who had expected to be able to walk north following the completion of the hostage release found the road was still blocked by Israeli tanks.
As crowds gathered along al-Rashid road in central Gaza to return home, gunshots were reportedly fired.
In one video posted online, which BBC Verify has confirmed was filmed on that road, people could be seen panicking and four gunshots could be heard.
In a separate incident, Reuters news agency, citing the Hamas-run health ministry, and Palestinian media reported one person was killed and others injured.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops in central Gaza had fired shots after ""several gatherings of dozens of suspects were identified who posed a threat to the forces"".
A statement continued: ""Contrary to reports emerging in recent hours, all of the shooting in the area was carried out for the purpose of distancing and not aimed at harm. We emphasise that as of this stage, no injuries to the suspects are known to have occurred as a result of the shooting.""
Under the terms of the ceasefire agreement, Palestinians had been scheduled to be allowed to travel north of the Netzarim Corridor, a seven kilometre (4.3 miles) strip of land controlled by Israel that cuts off north Gaza from the rest of the territory.
Qatari and Egyptian mediators who have facilitated talks between Israel and Hamas have made progress in their efforts to allow hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to the north.
Israel had asked the mediators for proof from Hamas that Ms Yehud is alive and it appeared that had been given to the Egyptians by Saturday evening, the BBC understands.
Meanwhile, many Gazans were watching anxiously for any breakthrough that could allow them to return.
For many, the hope of returning outweighs the reality of what awaits them: ruins and destruction.
Yet the dream of reclaiming their lives, rebuilding their homes and reuniting with their families are keeping their spirits alive.

Data shows there were 784 patients a day in hospitals with the virus last week.
This is up almost 80% on the same period the year before. 
Health Secretary Wes Streeting said patients ""continue to face unacceptable levels of care"" this winter despite a decline in some other winter viruses such as flu. 
Hospitals are currently seeing the highest levels of norovirus - a stomach bug that causes vomiting and diarrhoea - since January 2020.
Most healthy people recover in a few days, but it can cause serious problems in vulnerable people and young children.
One problem is that it spreads very easily - with just a few viral particles needed to infect someone -  for example through close contact with someone who has the virus, or by eating food prepared by someone with it.
It can also stick around on surfaces and has affected whole football teams in the past. 
This poses a challenge for hospitals - where entire wards sometimes need to be shut to new admissions if a patient is identified as having the virus. Wards then need  to be out of action to be deep-cleaned. 
The latest data on winter viruses shows:
Prof Julian Redhead, NHS national clinical director for urgent and emergency care, said norovirus, along with higher than normal rates of flu and other winter viruses – and continued issues in delays in discharging patients – means hospitals remain extremely busy with patients.
""Staff are working incredibly hard to see patients as quickly as possible, and it is welcome news that flu cases have now peaked. 
""Patients should continue to use 111 and 111 online if you need advice and support for health conditions, and call 999 or go to A&E in life-threatening emergencies.""
Streeting said: ""It's welcome that flu rates are starting to decline and ambulance handovers are improving – but we're not out of the woods yet.
""If you're eligible, it's not too late to get your flu vaccination - contact your local pharmacy or GP to protect yourself this winter.""

An audit of homes that have had external wall insulation since 2022 found ''widespread cases of poor-quality installations that did not meet the required standard'', Miatta Fahnbulleh told Parliament.
She added that 39 businesses have now been suspended from the government schemes as a result of poor-quality work.
Some 65,000 households in the UK have had solid wall insulation installed under two government schemes - ECO4 and the Great British Insulation Scheme - since 2022.
All homes that have had external wall insulation fitted under the schemes would be contacted by the energy regulator Ofgem, the minister said, with repair work overseen by the regulator and the cost met by installers.
The audit, which was carried out by the independent organisation Trustmark found problems ranging from missing or incomplete paperwork to more serious problems such as exposed insulation and poor ventilation which, if not fixed, could lead to damp and mould. In some cases, serious health and safety concerns were raised such as wires not being fitted properly.
Last year the BBC highlighted the case of Tormuja Khatun, whose Luton home has been consumed by black mould, mushrooms and dry rot after the botched installation of external wall insulation. Her family told the BBC they had been warned it could cost more than £100,000 to repair and described the situation as a ""nightmare"".
In total more than three million homes have been insulated under government schemes and the BBC reported last year that hundreds of thousands of them could have insulation that wasn't installed to the required standard. 
A growing number of MPs are worried about the impact on their constituents of poorly installed insulation, while Citizens Advice has called on the government to ""urgently fix"" regulation of the sector.
In a statement to the House of Commons, Fahnbulleh said: ''The government is moving fast to protect households. But I have to be honest with the House - these issues are the result of years of failure in a system that must be reformed. 
""I know that this will be concerning for families who have had solid wall insulation fitted through these schemes. Getting this sorted out is our number one priority. We are determined to make sure families are never let down in this way again.''
But some MPs voiced their concerns that the government did not announce a review of other insulation schemes, such as those involving cavity wall insulation and spray foam insulation. 
Fahnbulleh said audits of other forms of insulation had not shown the ""systemic failure'' found with solid wall installations.
The minister's statement was welcomed by the Energy Saving Trust (EST), which has been calling for a national expert advice service in England to provide all households with impartial, tailored advice.
""It's equally important that steps are now taken to strengthen consumer protection and support going forward, to ensure households have confidence when upgrading their homes,"" said Stew Horne, head of policy at the EST.

Ironstone Energy applied for planning permission to build the facility on farmland  on the Lincolnshire/Leicestershire border, just outside the village of Sewstern.
However, more than 1,200 people signed a petition against the plans, citing concerns about lorries and the visual impact on the countryside. 
South Kesteven District Council's planning committee formally rejected the application at a meeting on Thursday.
During the meeting, ward councillor David Bellamy said that a smaller facility would have been more suitable for the rural location.
""It's a question of scale,"" he said, adding that the application could set a precedent that would ""undoubtedly lead to further applications"".
Others echoed his concerns, including Councillor Ben Green who described it as ""an attempt to force an industrial scale anaerobic digestion plant into the heart of our cherished countryside"".
He also highlighted the strong opposition to the plans.
""It's clear the people most affected by this development do not want it,"" he added.
The company previously said the facility would convert about 130,000 tonnes of purpose-grown crops into biomethane, generating enough energy to supply gas for about 18,000 homes annually.
The application, which had been recommended for approval, also stated that the site was chosen because of its proximity to an existing high-pressure gas grid network and near farms that could provide purpose-grown crops, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.

David Clark, a 59-year-old teacher from Richmond in North Yorkshire, was fatally crushed by cattle while crossing a field in September 2020.
David and Andrew Turnbull had been due to stand trial but have now admitted a charge on a basis that was accepted by the prosecution at Teesside Crown Court.
The Turnbulls, of Low Whashton near Richmond, are due to be sentenced on 3 March with a fine the most likely punishment.
An inquest previously heard Mr Clark, the deputy head of Richmond School and a former Scotland Under-21 rugby player, was attacked while walking his two dogs.
He was crushed by cows suckling calves with a jury concluding his death was accidental.
Brothers David Turnbull, 60, and Andrew Turnbull, 57, were then prosecuted by the Health and Safety Executive and a two-week trial was due to be held in March.
But at a hearing on Friday, prosecutors said a basis of plea offered by the farmers was acceptable and they would now admit an offence based around not putting up enough warning signs advising walkers to take a different route.
Both pleaded guilty to failing to ensure the health and safety of persons other than employees while operating a farm.
Judge Jonathan Carroll said it was ""absolutely shocking"" the case had taken four years to conclude, and told the prosecution and defence barristers: ""It should have been resolved years ago.""
He said it had ultimately been resolved by prosecutors accepting that ""putting up a couple of signs would have satisfied any criminal liability"".
The judge said the delay was ""unfair"" to Mr Clark's family, whom the court heard had not engaged with the prosecution, and the Turnbulls.
He also said it was especially galling as the court system was ""buckling under the weight of its work"" with cases already being listed for 2027.
Prosecutors said they would not claim the health and safety breach was a ""significant"" cause of Mr Clark's death, adding that members of the public had remained entitled to use the footpath despite the alternative route being suggested.
Judge Carroll said the farmers would most likely be fined but demanded their barristers tell him what protections the Turnbulls would put in place in the future to protect members of the public from livestock.
""The public are entitled to know,"" the judge said.
A spokesperson for the HSE said: ""We note the comments made by the judge and now await sentencing of the defendants.""

321,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77jren0xgjo,2025-01-24,Man threatened to kill woman at knifepoint,"A ""dangerous"" man who held a woman at knifepoint and threatened to kill her twice has been jailed.
Claudio Stroud, 23, of Tennyson Street, Swindon, also attempted to strangle the victim, in her 20s, and assaulted two police officers who tried to arrest him.
He denied multiple charges but was found guilty at trial and sentenced to four years and nine months in prison.
""This case shows that we will always investigate, victims will be heard, and perpetrators put before the courts,"" said Wiltshire Police investigator Catherine Baird.
Stroud seriously assaulted the woman between 20 March and 23 March 2023 when he was on licence from prison due to similar crimes against a different victim, Wiltshire Police said.
He was arrested on 23 March 2023, fracturing the finger of one officer and spraining the wrist of another as he was detained.
Stroud was charged after statements, photos of injuries, abusive messages and recordings were given to police by the victim and family members.
At trial he was found guilty of controlling and coercive behaviour, threats to kill, two counts of actual bodily harm, two counts of threatening with an offensive weapon in a private place, and two counts of assault of an emergency worker.
""I want to highlight and emphasise the bravery of the victim in this case – without her courage and her victim impact statement, we wouldn't have been able to secure this conviction and sentence,"" Ms Baird said.
""Stroud's behaviour has had a significant impact on the victim, and I hope this sentence and restraining order will give her some form of closure and allow her to start moving on with her life.""
During the sentencing hearing at Swindon Crown Court on Friday, Stroud was also handed an extended licence period of two years and a 10-year restraining order.

322,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgl7ge39y3o,2025-01-25,Team develops AI tool to find potential for mould,"An AI tool which is said to be able to detect the potential for mould before it develops has been created by researchers at a West Yorkshire university.
The technology examines buildings, including homes, to identify areas likely to be prone to dampness and mould, then suggests plans to solve the problem, according to the team at Leeds Beckett University.
Dr Jamiu Dauda, who led the research, said it could prove ""very useful"" if it was eventually rolled out commercially.
""This app is just like you having an AI agent that comes to your home and tells you that mould is, or isn't, coming,"" he said.
According to government estimates, the number of homes in England with damp and mould could be up to 6.5 million.
Dr Dauda said it was ""especially"" the case that social housing was affected by mould.
Following the death of two-year-old Awaab Ishak in 2020, which a coroner concluded was due to exposure to mould in his home, Awaab's Law was launched, requiring social housing landlords to quickly investigate and fix hazardous conditions such as mould in homes.
Dr Dauda said the ""preventative"" technology developed at Leeds Beckett could calculate the risk of a house developing mould using measurements such as the size of the building and its energy performance.
The tool, developed by the university and construction company BuildEco, was currently being used by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, he explained.
It was hoped landlords, tenants and homeowners could use it in the future, according to Dr Dauda.
""That's where it's going to be most effective,"" he said.
""The SME's are trying to roll out what we have now to social housing. Based on that, then they are going to go into full commercialisation.""
Dr Dauda said the aim for the full roll-out would be for data to be collected automatically through a smart meter, which could then produce recommendations on how to avoid mould.

The museum alleged that the contractor entered the building and accessed the systems before being arrested. 
It led to some galleries being closed on Friday, the museum added, along with temporary exhibitions that remain closed. 
The Metropolitan Police confirmed that a man had been arrested at the museum and bailed pending further inquiries.
The museum said capacity was limited for this weekend, with members and those who already hold tickets given priority. 
A British Museum spokesman told the BBC: ""An IT contractor who was dismissed last week trespassed into the museum and shut down several of our systems. 
""Police attended and he was arrested at the scene.
""We are working hard to get the museum back to being fully operational but with regret our temporary exhibitions have been closed today and will remain so over the weekend – ticket holders have been alerted and refunds offered.""
Customers who already hold tickets for this weekend have been contacted ahead of their visit.
A Met Police spokesman said officers were called at 20:25 GMT on Thursday to reports that a man had entered the museum and caused damage to security and IT systems.
""Police swiftly attended and arrested a man in his 50s at the scene on suspicion of burglary and criminal damage,"" he added. ""He has been bailed pending further enquiries.""
The British Museum - which holds items including the Rosetta Stone, the Anglo-Saxon ship burial at Sutton Hoo and the contested Parthenon Sculptures - sees millions of people go through its doors each year to see the permanent collections and exhibitions.
Last year it was named the top UK visitor attraction, having had 5,820,860 visitors in 2023.
There are currently three temporary exhibitions, including Silk Roads and Picasso: Printmaker. 
The museum said it apologised for any inconvenience and asked customers to contact its box office to reschedule their visits or have tickets refunded.

Tucked away among a warren of quiet country roads south of Nottingham, the village prides itself on the community spirit displayed in marking major events.
The village marks celebrations such as Christmas, jubilees and sporting events by decorating the area with wooden rabbits, which are cut to a template but individually repainted to reflect a theme.
But organisers have found all but 10 of the 27 original figures have, over the years, gone missing and have appealed for locals to hop to it and return them.
According to the Nottinghamshire History website, the name of the village comes from the Saxon word Bune, meaning reeds.
But more than a decade ago it inspired the Bunny Improvement Group, a team of volunteers, to start making wooden rabbits to mark special occasions.
Now meeting to plan for VE celebrations later this year has led to the realisation most of the figures were unaccounted for.
Stella Alldred, from the group, said: ""Over the years we have, unfortunately, had about three stolen from the lamp-posts where we used to display them.
""But we have also given them out to people in the village to decorate and, for one reason or another, they have not been returned.
""They are quite expensive to cut out and make so we have put out this appeal so we can get them back for events this year.""
The rabbits come in two sizes, with ""adults"" about 1m (3ft) high and ""babies"" less than half that size, and made of either plywood or MDF.
Ms Alldred said: ""So if anyone has one could you return it or let us know you have it and whether you intend to decorate it for the next event.
""If we don't get them it means we have to find the wood for more bunnies and start all over again.""

325,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqld2nzen20o,2025-01-24,Rail tunnel flooding is 'biggest problem' in area,"A section of railway that floods during storms is ""by far and away"" the biggest problem of its kind in the region, Network Rail has said.
The Chipping Sodbury tunnel, to the north of Bristol, was built in 1901 but it and the section nearby suffers during wet weather.
A lagoon was installed in 2018 as part of a flood alleviation scheme designed to improve the resilience of the railway line.
George Barratt, project manager for Network Rail, said ""bigger storm events"" meant the flooding there was something they ""needed to get on top of"".
The tunnel is on the main line that links Cardiff and Bristol Parkway with Swindon and London Paddington beyond.
Already this winter, there have been several closures of the line during storms.
But it is hoped the lagoon and changes to drainage will help shorten the closures.
Alongside the lagoon, Mr Barratt said a series of monitoring tools had been installed next to the railway to show when it has flooded and for them to understand where the flood water is flowing from.
""We are doing a piece of work at the moment to ensure we keep a main route between London Paddington and Cardiff open,"" he said.
""At certain times that means certain sections we are going to have to deal with certain bits of flood water.
""But it's about bouncing back quicker.
""Instead of being shut for seven or eight days, it might be shut for a few hours, then we can reopen,"" added Mr Barratt.
Julie Gregory from Network Rail said despite storms they had reduced the amount of time the railway is closed.
She said they had removed 35 tonnes of material from the railway drainage system to ensure the lagoon works better.
""There is one thing we are going to do which will reduce the amount of water here which is to pump some water away from the other end of the tunnel,"" Ms Gregory added.
""That will help us free up some capacity in our drainage system which is much needed.""

Wiltshire Council's planned budget for 2025/26 has been set at £527.42m, compared to last year's £490m.
The proposals, which will debated at a full council meeting on 25 February, also include the council increasing it's portion of council tax by 4.5%, less than the maximum 4.99% permitted by central government. 
Council leader, Richard Clewer, said: ""Our preventative long-term approach and investing time and resources into our key services ensures that we are on a firm footing.""
If the plans are approved, it would result in a typical Band D household paying an extra £1.56 per week for the Wiltshire Council portion of council tax.
The council said it would face challenges in the year ahead as due to various cuts and changes to grant schemes, it will receive just under £8m less in funding from central government as a whole.
However, it may receive additional funding for services such as recycling.
""The budget gets trickier to set every year, but we have learned to be as self-reliant as possible and that's perhaps where some other local authorities have fallen short,"" said Clewer.
""Councils throughout the country are dipping into their reserves to support their budgets, but we are not in that position. ""
About £6.4m of savings have been identified to close the remaining budget gap for 2025/26, the leader added.
Spending under the new budget will include:
It will also include funds for flood defences, refurbishment of council houses, and improvements to schools.

Kevin Richardson, 58, had his Wokingham home raided by police in April 2022, where officers found drugs with an estimated value of about £77,000.
The drugs he was selling included zopiclone, pregabalin, diazepam, alprazolam, tramadol and alprazolam, which require a prescription.
Richardson, who posted the illegal medication via the Royal Mail, was jailed for nine years and nine months at Reading Crown Court on Wednesday.
Several devices found at his home were signed into dark web marketplace accounts.
He had earlier admitted:
Elena Vickers, from the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (SEROCU), said an investigation into Richardson took three years.
""Richardson recklessly distributed these drugs on the dark web to vulnerable individuals worldwide without regard for the potentially devastating consequences they could have,"" she said.
""Buying pharmaceutical products from the dark web can be extremely dangerous. Although they may look legitimate, the capsules are sometimes manufactured with unsafe products which can pose a risk to whoever takes them.
""There are reasons why only doctors can prescribe such medication such as ensuring correct dosages and being able to monitor any side effects. You should seek medical attention if you have purchased drugs in this way.""

328,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy48k0e185xo,2025-01-23,London social housing waiting lists at decade high,"London's social housing waiting lists are at a 10-year high, according to figures.
Analysis of government data by London Councils found that there were 336,366 households on waiting lists for social housing in 2024 across the capital's 32 boroughs.
This is the highest figure in more than a decade and a 32% increase since 2014, with the previous record being set in 2013 at 344,294.
A government spokesperson called the figures ""unacceptable"" and said ""urgent action"" was being taken to build 1.5 million homes in England by 2029.
London now accounts for about 25% of England's total number of households waiting for social housing, according to the figures.
London Councils, which represents the capital's 32 borough councils and the City of London, has warned of a homelessness emergency, with an acute shortage of affordable homes as a key factor.
Analysis from the cross-party body suggests that more than 183,000 Londoners are currently homeless and living in temporary accommodation arranged by their local boroughs, which is equivalent to at least one in 50 residents of London.
Councils are struggling with significant financial constraints and challenges to housing delivery, a London Councils spokesperson said.
Boroughs face a £700m black hole in their social housing finances between 2023-24 and 2027-28 due to rising costs and previous government caps on social rent levels.
They are also spending £4m every day on temporary accommodation, which has increased by 68% in the past year.
Labour councillor Grace Williams, London Councils' executive member for housing and regeneration, said that the growing number of people on social housing waiting lists demonstrated the ""spiralling pressures"" in the capital.
She added: ""The capital is becoming increasingly unaffordable and, as these numbers demonstrate, there is a desperate need for more social housing.""
The London Councils spokesperson said boroughs were calling for increased financial support for the social housing sector from the government, emphasising the need for sustainable social rent levels to boost investment in new homes. 
They also want to see the removal of the 2011 cap on Local Housing Allowance for temporary accommodation, as the current subsidy does not cover rising costs. 
They also urged the government to make the recent increase in Local Housing Allowance rates permanent, with annual updates to match market rents and better support low-income tenants.
The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: ""Local government has suffered from years of short-term decisions, so we have already set out important steps to help them deliver the homes we need, including overdue reforms to the Right to Buy scheme and an extra £500m for the Affordable Homes Programme. 
""We will set out further measures in due course.""

Wellsway School in Keynsham, near Bristol, has been reported to the Information Commissioner's Office after 86,000 lines of sensitive information was emailed to a couple.
They were sent the data after they submitted a Freedom of Information request because they felt the secondary school's withdrawal room was being used excessively.
The school said it had ""immediately followed through with all procedures and informed parents"" when it became aware of the data breach.
It was only after having the spreadsheet of data for a few weeks that the couple, who wish to remain anonymous, realised it contained comprehensive data on children.
As well as their name and date of birth, it listed whether they were considered to have special educational needs or be on an educational health and care plan.
It also contained details of child protection orders and whether pupils are eligible for free school meals.
Head teacher Rob Pearsall said the family assured the school they had deleted the data.
""We have done all we can to make sure that data has not been shared.
""It was a regrettable mistake and we have apologised to parents,"" he added.
The couple had initially sent the FOI because their ""happy and positive"" daughter was frequently being sent to the school's withdrawal room.
Schools commonly have such a space for disruptive students, but the parents say it is being utilised to punish ""petty"" rule infractions at Wellsway.
The girl's mother said the school, which is run by the Futura Learning Partnership, had been dismissive of their concerns.
Her father said the school had made them feel ""we were the only ones this was happening to"".
""It wasn't. This is happening to lots of children and for very petty things in the class room.""
""The Department for Education guidance states children should only be removed from lessons if their behaviour is extremely disruptive,"" said the girl's mother, a former teacher herself.
""Whether [rule breaking] is minor or severe, it's the same punishment. It's a sledgehammer approach,"" he claims.
The school says that children sent to the withdrawal room are given suitable and equivalent work to complete.
When asked if pupils might be losing out on education, Mr Pearsall replied: ""All I can do is give assurances that teachers carefully monitor and work with children to make sure they don't lose out and the do catch up.
""The data we have internally and the success [pupils] have in their GCSEs would reflect that does not happen.""
He said that an Ofsted inspection carried out before Christmas had found that the school's behavioural policy was good.

Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said the initiative would ""deliver transformative regeneration across our city-region"".
Manchester City Council leader Bev Craig said the city-region had ""so much untapped potential, so that's why we are rolling up our sleeves and doing things differently"".
Oldham Council leader Arooj Shah described the plan as ""a game-changer for boroughs like Oldham"".
Oldham would be part of a north east growth corridor, with an area called Atom Valley located in Oldham, Bury and Rochdale, so called due to its focus on boosting scientific research and development.

Ethan Sinclair, 17, from Smethwick in the West Midlands, said he was on his way to collect an electric scooter from a seller in Walsall when he slipped trying to avoid a puddle.
He said he had been trying to follow Google Maps in the town centre at the time: ""It was dark, there were no lights and no rails.""
The Canal and River Trust said it was constantly reviewing the situation but there was not a simple solution. Walsall Council said it was not responsible for the area around the canal basin.
Numerous people as well as several vehicles have fallen or gone into the canal basin  in Walsall over recent years.
Mr Sinclair said: ""The second my foot slipped I knew I was going in. I fell right to the bottom. It must have been at least six or seven feet.""
There was a mooring ring close to the spot where he fell in: ""I quickly jumped back up and my fingertips managed to grab onto the edge.""
People at a nearby cafe then helped him out of the water. ""They said I was the third or fourth person that day,"" he added.
After initially turning down an ambulance, he took himself to hospital when his hands went blue and his breathing became difficult. Doctors later gave him the all clear.
In 2021, the Canal and River Trust installed a six foot tall blue buoy in the canal basin with the words ""deep water"" written on it, after three people fell into the basin in one day. 
Two cars have also driven into the basin.
A spokesperson for the trust said it was sorry to hear about Mr Sinclair's accident and added: ""This must have been a very unpleasant experience, so we're glad he was given the all clear after sensibly seeking medical advice.""
The trust confirmed that, as well as installing the buoy, it had removed weeds to make it clear where the edge of the water lay.
They said they do not own the land around the canal and added: ""Although fencing off the waterfront may appear a straightforward solution, it is sadly not that simple in practice"". 
Walsall Council, which is responsible for street lighting, said the canal basin was the responsibility of the Canal and River Trust.
It also pointed to plans to redevelop the area around Gallery Square and improve the canal basin area.
Mr Sinclair said the incident had left him feeling anxious about leaving the house: ""Anything could happen now. I'm staying in a lot more. College is the only place I really go.""

The girl, who can only be referred to Child C, was nine years old when knife-wielding Axel Rudakubana embarked upon what prosecutors described as a ""meticulously planned campaign of murder and violence"" at a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.
Child C's family said she was continuing to recover from the 29 July attack, in which Rudakubana, then aged 17, also attempted to murder eight other children and two adults.
He was jailed for 52 years on Thursday after also admitting making the biological toxin ricin and illegally possessing an Al Qaeda training manual.
Six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice da Silva Aguiar, aged nine, were killed in the attack.
Dance class leader Leanne Lucas and businessman Jonathan Hayes were seriously wounded.
At Thursday's sentencing hearing, Child C's words were read out at Liverpool Crown Court.
She said: ""It has been very hard to deal with what happened.
""When people in school asked me 'Do you wish you weren't there that day?', I said that, in some ways, I wish I wasn't but also, if I wasn't there, someone else would have been stabbed and they could have died, so I'm glad I might have stopped someone else getting hurt.""
Child C's family said: ""It is undeniable that there remain more questions which need answering about how we got to this point. 
""We hope that these will be answered in due course.
""For our daughter, and everyone else who was there that day, it is the least that they deserve.""
Their statement continued: ""Our hearts continue to ache for the families of Alice, Bebe and Elsie.
""We are acutely aware of how incredibly lucky we are that our daughter is still with us.""
Child C's family thanked everyone - including members of the emergency services and staff at Alder Hey Children's Hospital - who had been involved in saving her life and helping her recovery.
""Words cannot express how grateful we will forever be to you,"" said the family in their statement, before adding that Child C ""continues to make a good recovery"".
""She remains the positive, funny, determined, caring girl she always was. She is our warrior.""
They added that the attack ""will not define her"" and appealed for privacy ""while we as a family try to come to terms with the events of 29 July"".
Following Rudakubana's guilty pleas on Monday, the government announced a public inquiry.
The court heard Rudakubana had been referred three times to anti-extremism programme Prevent, once in 2019 - when he researched American school shootings during an IT class - and twice in 2021, for uploading images of former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi to Instagram and for researching the 2017 London Bridge terror attack.
In 2019, he also contacted the Childline charity and asked: ""What should I do if I want to kill somebody?""
On Thursday, prosecutor Deanna Heer KC told the court that Rudakubana had booked a taxi later that year to take him to his former school, where he used a hockey stick to attack another pupil.
Police then found a kitchen knife in his backpack.
He then pleaded guilty to assault, possession of an offensive weapon and possession of a bladed article.
Rudakubana was also reported missing in 2022 before he was found by police in possession of a small kitchen knife.

Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust reported fewer pups being born at Donna Nook Nature Reserve, near Louth, and in other areas on the east coast.
In total, 1,649 pups were born between October and December at the reserve which is a 25% fall compared to the previous year.
The trust said the decline is the largest since monitoring started 40 years ago investigations into the possible causes will take place.
The first pup of the 2024 season was born on 29 October at Donna Nook with the final one arriving on 22 December.
The total number of grey seal pups born was 1,649, down from 2,207 the year before.
The trust said over the last five years, pup numbers at Donna Nook had remained stable at around 2,200 and are unsure of the reason behind the decline. 
A decrease in seal pup populations in other areas along the east coast has also been reported. 
The Sea Mammal Research Unit, a marine science research organisation in Scotland, is investigating possible causes of the decline.

Salisbury's City Hall, which was south Wiltshire's largest concert venue, closed in January 2023.
The last show held in the building was before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Leader of Wiltshire Council, Richard Clewer said it had been a priority to reopen City Hall as a live entertainment venue in a ""long-term sustainable way"".
The announcement comes after the council hired a specialist company to market the venue on its behalf.
The name of the operator cannot be revealed until terms and a lease are agreed. But the council's cabinet have approved £300,000 of funding to make improvements to the outside of the building. 
Richard Clewer, said: ""Finding that partner who is able to commit to a long-term sustainable solution that doesn't rely on council funding was the main aim and to make sure city hall can open before a new tenant can move in. 
""I'm really pleased that we've got to that point"", he said.
""There are definitely still some works that need to be done in order to make sure city hall can open, but from everything I am hearing we are looking at the prospect of work being able to be done in time and for city hall to open this year. 
""But that will be in the hands of the new leaseholder.""
The council are expected to confirm the name of the new operator in the coming weeks.

Drypool Bridge over the River Hull will be shut for work on its load-bearing columns after a routine inspection in April 2024 found they had significantly deteriorated.
Due to the year-long delay in the A63 Castle Street roadworks, both projects will run alongside each other, causing ""unavoidable disruption"" to the city's road network.
Garry Taylor, Hull City Council's assistant director of major projects, said ""the best possible traffic management and mitigation measures"" would be put in place ""to reduce the likely impact"". 
The bridge, which opened in 1961, carries an essential road route over the River Hull into the city centre. It is also used by pedestrians.
After the safety investigation in April, the council said the bridge would be closed for up to 12 months, but it reopened two weeks later after safety checks.
""Significant damage"" was discovered to several concrete columns under the bridge.
Subject to cabinet approval, the council will appoint Esh Contruction and Mason Clark Associates to repair and strengthen the structure.
The authority said the work was expected to cost £8m.
The council said it wanted to start the work this spring because if it was to be delayed, the next available period to undertake the repairs would be spring/summer 2026, with the risk of increased costs.
The authority warned of road closures and diversions in the area, which will also coincide with the A63 roadworks that have been delayed for a year.
The £355m redesign that involves lowering the level of the A63 to create an underpass was pushed back due to ""extremely challenging ground conditions"", highways officials said.
The council said: ""The two schemes will be managed through a co-ordinated approach by the council alongside all other highway works.""

338,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yv9ej9n49o,2025-01-24,Campaigners dismiss loan charge review as 'sham',"The government has launched its promised independent review into the loan charge but has been met with criticism from campaigners who dismissed it as a ""sham"".
The loan charge was implemented to close a tax loophole and recover backdated taxes but has left many freelance workers facing large bills. 
In a statement on Thursday, Treasury Minister James Murray said the review would look at barriers preventing those owing money from ""reaching resolution with HMRC and to recommend ways in which they can be encouraged to do so"".
However, it will not reconsider the government's position that the loan charge is fair.
This has led the Loan Charge Action Group to dismiss the review as a ""sham"" and a ""complete betrayal"".
""What the government has announced today is not a review at all, as it actually astonishingly excludes reviewing the loan charge,"" said group founder Steve Packham.
He said the review failed to look at how HMRC set up the loan charge and who operated and promoted the tax avoidance schemes. 
In 1999, the then-Labour government introduced IR 35, a tax law which sought to class many self-employed freelance workers as employers, meaning they would have to pay National Insurance.
Thousands subsequently signed up to schemes, promoted by lawyers and accountants, allowing them to legally avoid paying National Insurance. 
This usually involved the freelancers paying money to offshore companies, who loaned it back to them without expecting the loan to be repaid. 
After the government shut this loophole, the Treasury used the loan charge to ask the freelancers to pay backdated tax.
HMRC estimates around 50,000 people are affected by the loan charge. 
Announcing a review of the loan charge, Treasury Minister James Murray said: ""The government believes that it is right that those who did not pay the right amount of income tax and National Insurance are required to resolve their affairs with HMRC.
""Accepting otherwise would be contrary to the decisions of the courts and would be unfair to the vast majority of taxpayers who have never used these schemes."" 
However, he added that there was concern about the charge, particularly the size of some payments and whether people were able to pay ""in a reasonable timeframe"".
He said the review would aim ""to bring the matter to a close or those affected; ensure fairness for all taxpayers; and ensure that appropriate support is in place for those subject to the loan charge"".
It will be conducted by Ray McCann, a former President of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, who is expected to report back by the summer. 
Judith Freedman, a professor of tax law and policy at Oxford University, said she was ""full of admiration"" for McCann adding: ""Not an easy job but if anyone can sort it out he can.""
Conservative MP Greg Smith, and co-chair of the Loan Charge All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), said the announcement of the review was ""a farce"".
""This is not the review that was promised nor the review that is so desperately needed and the APPG will continue to push for a genuine inquiry into this scandal,"" he said.

Homeowners on the Byker Estate have complained they are being charged ""ridiculous"" amounts by Newcastle City Council to use the area's district heat network.
Residents are charged a flat fee for power generated from the station on Walker Road, but the system is not covered by the Energy Price Cap and the council said it will not use public funds to subsidise residents.
Pensioner Roberta Davidson, whose monthly bill jumped from £108 to £213 in December, said the council's response was ""not solving the problem"".
She told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: ""It is not answering the question of why we are paying double. 
""We are no further forward.""

Newcastle City Council's director of housing and communities Vicky McDermott said in a letter to Ms Davidson that the local authority ""does not benefit financially from any income received from heat network customers, and that our charging only reflects the costs of providing energy to you all"".
Ms McDermott added bills are expected to fall in the next financial year ""in line with declining gas prices"".
But Labour councillor Paula Maines said the authority, run by a minority Labour administration, was not willing to make any promises about reducing bills.
In a separate letter to Byker councillor Nick Hartley, she said: ""We are unable to issue blanket assurances about costs going down – gas prices are falling now, but we do not know if this will change, and we are also expecting increased compliance and regulatory oversight from Ofgem. 
""We will not give promises we cannot necessarily keep, and we cannot, as a council, expect our council taxpayers to subsidise Byker heating bills.""

The former This Morning host left the show in October 2023, saying she wanted to spend more time with her family, after the plot emerged. 
Willoughby, in her first interview for more than a year, admitted she found it ""really so hard"" to talk about what had happened.
But she said she had made a decision to ""focus on everything that's positive and good"" and is healthy and happy.
Gavin Plumb was last summer found guilty of soliciting murder and inciting rape and kidnap, following a trial at Chelmsford Crown Court. He was jailed for life, with a minimum term of 16 years. 
Willoughby, who waived her right to anonymity in connection with the case, told the Sunday Times' Style magazine: ""It's been a tough one. There's no way of sugar-coating it.""
The 43-year-old said: ""When something like that happens, you have a decision to make. 
""You can either decide, right, I can take this on board and it can absolutely affect all aspects of my life, or I can make a choice to go, let's focus on everything that's positive and good, all those important things.""
She spoke of her ""wonderful"" husband, children, friends and family, adding: ""You have to go: I choose to positively move forward and rely on all those people - the police, the court, the judge, the jury - all those people to do their role. And that's what I had to do.""
Willoughby said it was ""not an option"" for her to let the situation take over her life. 
""So many people go through tough things - they just do,"" she told interviewer Polly Vernon. 
She added: ""Although I wouldn't wish what happened on me on anybody at all - sometimes things go wrong, but you have to keep going for it because that's all you can do."" 
When she left This Morning, her co-host of more than a decade Philip Schofield had already stepped down earlier that year over an affair with a former colleague which he described as ""unwise but not illegal"".
Asked if it was terrifying to walk away from the programme, Willoughby said: ""That question is wrapped up in so many things that were going on at that time. 
""But no. That was the last thing on my mind. The choice was really simple and easy, actually."" 
A lot of the change has been ""really good"", Willoughby said, as she can do the school run and attend assemblies. 
""Without even realising it, I think I've missed that. It's really lovely to get some of that back."" 
She did not discuss Schofield in the Sunday Times interview.
Having spent some time away from work, Willoughby has resumed hosting duties on shows like Dancing on Ice, with her next venture being Netflix's Celebrity Bear Hunt. 
Despite describing herself as ""a wimp"" compared to co-host Bear Grylls, she admitted: ""I'm made of quite tough stuff. 
""I have that thing where I definitely would rather take the easy option, but I know, if I have to, there is something in there.""

341,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25x2lvk7ro,2025-01-27,Lebanon ceasefire deal extended as initial deadline passes,"The US and Lebanon say the ceasefire deal with Israel - which had been due to expire on Sunday - has been extended until mid-February. 
Israel had kept troops deployed in Lebanon beyond the initial deadline, accusing the Lebanese government of not fully implementing its part of the deal, which required the removal of Hezbollah from the area.
On Sunday, the Lebanese health ministry said Israeli soldiers killed 22 people and wounded 124 others who were trying to return to their homes in the country's south.
Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati says, following contact from the US, the truce will now remain in place until 18 February.
The initial ceasefire plan, announced in late November, brought an end to 14 months of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. 
Brokered by the US and France, the agreement gave Hezbollah 60 days to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon and required Israeli forces to withdraw over the same period. 
Announcing the plan, then-US President Joe Biden said it was ""designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities"" between the two sides. 
But on Friday, with two days to go before the deadline, Israel said some soldiers would remain in the region as the ceasefire agreement was ""yet to be fully enforced by the Lebanese state"". 
A White House statement on Sunday said the deadline has now been moved to 18 February, and that negotiations will begin for the return of Lebanese prisoners captured after 7 October 2023.
Thousands of Lebanese residents have returned to towns and villages near the border since the deal was agreed, despite warnings that the region was still unsafe.
On Sunday, the Lebanese health ministry said 22 people had been killed by Israeli soldiers in the area.
The Israeli military said it had fired ""warning shots in multiple areas"", without specifying if people had been hit, and apprehended several people it claimed posed an ""imminent threat"".
The longstanding conflict between Israel and Hezbollah - an Iranian-backed militant, political and social movement - escalated last September. This lead to an intense Israeli air campaign across Lebanon, a ground invasion of the country's south, and the assassination of Hezbollah's senior leaders. 
The offensive killed around 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led more than 1.2 million residents to be displaced.
Israel's stated goal was to allow the return of around 60,000 residents who had fled from communities in the country's north because of Hezbollah's attacks, and to remove the group from areas along the border.
Hezbollah launched its campaign the day after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

His recent projects include the Ken Spelman bookshop on Micklegate and P&S Hobbies and Models on Walmgate, which closed last week.
He said: ""I love the stories people tell me about these places, they mean quite a lot to people.""
Mr Liptrot said he enjoyed the ""everyday"" nature of a shopfront, and how they were something that people ""might not normally look at much or give much time to"".
""I love the intricacies, the colour and the detail,"" he added. 
""I come out and sketch directly in front of the buildings. You bump into all sorts of people!""
He added that growing up in a family-run shop helped to inspire his work.
""My mum and dad ran a newsagent back in Runcorn where I'm from, so it's deeply ingrained in me, sticking up for the small businesses,"" he said.
""The high street is ever changing, and I feel like it must be a struggle for these shops, so I'm rooting for them.""
Mr Liptrot also sketches some of the city's favourite quirkier venues.
""It's also about celebrating ones that are still going, like music venue The Crescent and the York Nut Centre with its iconic monkey nut character hanging outside.""
He has also drawn landmark buildings, like the former York City football ground on Bootham Crescent. 
""When I'm doing stalls, people come up to me and tell me their memories of these places. The football ground was a big deal for fans.
""I'm recording these places as a sort of memory for people."" he said.

Video footage verified by the BBC shows a fireball rising over the refinery and pumping station in the Ryazan region, southeast of Moscow, which Ukrainian officials said was a target.
Russia said it had shot down 121 drones that had targeted 13 regions, including Ryazan and Moscow, but reported no damage.
Elsewhere, Ukrainian authorities said three people were killed and one was injured when a Russian drone hit a residential building in the Kyiv region.
Andriy Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's centre for countering disinformation, said on Telegram that an oil refinery in Ryazan had been hit, as well as the Kremniy factory in Bryansk that Kyiv says produces missile components and other weapons.
Bloggers on Telegram posted images and videos of fires raging at the Ryazan facility, which covers around 6sq km (2.3sq miles). Verified footage shows people fleeing from the site in cars and on foot as a fireball rises into the sky.
BBC Verify used video footage to establish the location of two fires at the refinery. One video shows a fire near the northern entrance, whose location was matched by the road layout, signs and fences. 
Two other videos show a larger fire on the eastern side of the refinery, around 3km (1.6m) away from the first. The location was identified by matching trees, pylons, road and path layouts.
Russian state-owned news agency RIA cited a statement from the Kremniy factory in Bryansk, which said work had been suspended after an attack by six drones.  Pavel Malkov, the regional governor, said emergency services were responding.
The Kremlin acknowledged the attacks but made no mention of damage or casualties. 
It claimed to have destroyed 121 Ukrainian drones, including six over the Moscow region, 20 in the Ryazan region, and a number over the border region of Bryansk.
Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, said the city's air defences had intercepted attacks by Ukrainian drones at four locations.
He said air defences southeast of the capital in Kolomna and Ramenskoye had also repelled drones, without specifying how many. He said there was no damage.
Russian news agencies quoted Rosaviatsiya, the federal aviation agency, as saying two Moscow airports, Vnukovo and Domodedovo, had resumed flights after suspending operations for a time. Six flights were redirected to other airports.
In the city of Kursk, Mayor Igor Kutsak said overnight attacks had damaged power lines and cut off electricity to one district.
In Ukraine, officials said that its air defences had destroyed 25 of 58 drones launched overnight by Russia. 
The interior ministry said debris from one of the drones had killed two men and a woman in Hlevakha, Kyiv region, and that another person had been injured. 
Russia's justice ministry on Friday designated the BBC Russian service's Olga Ivshina a ""foreign agent"".
Ivshina, who is based in London, is the fourth BBC journalist to be designated by Russia since the full invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022.
Last week BBC Russian's Anastasia Lotareva, a senior editor in Riga, and Andrey Kozenko, a reporter in London, were added to the list.
Those named as foreign agents are compelled to mark any online content available in Russia as having come from a foreign agent, and to share financial details. Failure to comply can lead to fines or even imprisonment.
A spokesperson for the BBC said the corporation ""strongly rejects and will challenge the designation"".
""The role of BBC News Russian journalists, reporting independently and impartially, has never been needed more, and we will support them to ensure they can continue to do their jobs serving Russian-speaking audiences.""

Fees were introduced to launch boats, kayaks and paddleboards from the slipway at Minehead Harbour in April 2024 - and Somerset Council now wants to increase them by about 3%.
Members of Minehead Sailing Club, which stopped operating after the fees were introduced, spoke to councillors on Monday and called for the fees to be waived.
The council said the fees mean it is able to run the harbour on a ""cost neutral basis and meet our requirements under the Port Marine Safety Code.
The current fees mean people must pay either a £16 daily fee or a £200 annual fee to launch from the harbour.
The council has given the sailing club a discount for kayaks and paddleboards, which cost club members £20 a year.
Despite this, the club says it has been forced to stop operating after losing 25 members.
Speaking at a meeting of the council's harbour management advisory committee, the sailing club's secretary Debbie Allum said: ""It would be appropriate, and appreciated, if the current and pending fees could be waived to allow paddles, oars and sail-based craft to launch, without further delay.""
Councillor Andy Hadley said an ""simple solution"" to be found so the harbour can ""get back to work"".
""It's dying down there,"" he added.
Mr Hadley told the committee any agreement ""should encompass all the crafts"" the club uses.
The committee said it would hold talks with the sailing club in the near future.
The area's MP Rachel Gilmour told BBC News she is ""working on a resolution"" and will raise the issue with the Department for Transport.
She added: ""I hope there is a positive outcome soon so the people of Minehead can enjoy their harbour, which I hope can become a crucial asset for the town and wider community.""

Liam Burke, 26, was given a life sentence for a murder in 2015, and was later referred to high-security Rampton Hospital in Nottinghamshire for treatment.
He attacked Kyle Bowers from behind whilst in Rampton on 5 June 2023, punching him and biting part of his ear off, Nottingham Crown Court heard.
On Friday, appearing via video link from HMP Frankland, near Durham, Burke was sentenced to four months for causing grievous bodily harm to Mr Bowers - a term which will run consecutively to a 10-year minimum sentence imposed for the murder.
Speaking to the BBC outside court, Mr Bowers said his attacker's sentence was ""nothing compared to a lifetime of suffering"".
The 24-year-old, from Doncaster, watched Burke being sentenced, and said: ""He's left a noticeable scar, now for life, a deformity.
""It's left me permanently scarred for life, physically and mentally. And he's got an extra four months, which is nothing on his time. 
""It's nothing compared to a lifetime of suffering.""
He said he was still receiving therapy following the ""random attack"", which left him with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.
The court was told when staff had asked Burke where the ear was, he replied: ""It's down in the toilet. I'll come and help you if you like.""
He pleaded guilty to the offence at the first opportunity, the court heard.
The sentence also means Burke will not be eligible for parole for a further two months.
Mr Bowers said he had now ""closed the chapter"", but added: ""I'm struggling a lot. I'm struggling to sleep, struggling to do day-to-day things. I can't go out there because of the fear of being attacked again.""
He underwent surgery for his ear, and said he had not returned to the hospital since.
""I've lost my career [because of this], and it's just not nice,"" he added.
""There's more to it than just losing part of my ear. I've lost everything.""

The 73-year-old set off his distress beacon on Saturday after getting into difficulty approximately 80km (50 miles) west of Lacanau, the Préfecture maritime de l'Atlantique, a French government organisation, said in a statement.
A French air force helicopter was dispatched to find the man, but found his 12-metre yacht, the Tiger PA, ""eviscerated"" in the Bay of Biscay.
Two divers were then winched down to the wreckage, where they discovered an empty raft, officials added.
A Portuguese cargo ship and a Spanish hospital vessel were both diverted to the area and to help with the search, alongside the French navy.
After several hours of searching, it was called off in the early hours of Sunday morning ""due to a lack of information"".
The incident came after officials were first alerted to the Tiger PA on Friday evening when it did not respond to radio messages, the Préfecture maritime de l'Atlantique said in a statement.
A Portuguese cargo ship later established radio contact with the yacht and spoke to the 73-year-old sailor, who said he was safe.
In the statement, the Préfecture maritime de l'Atlantique reminded people to be careful in the waters during the stormy weather.
Storm Herminia, named by the Spanish weather service Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) on Friday, brought heavy rains and wind battered the north of Spain and western France.
Gusts of wind exceeded 62mph and floodwaters caused by the storm also left cars and buildings submerged in western France.

349,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gwevq7yweo,2025-01-23,"Council solar panels 11 years late, say Greens","Solar panels installed by Highland Council as part of efforts to make Inverness greener have been switched on more than a decade late, according to the Scottish Greens.
The £20,000 renewable energy scheme was fitted to the roof of the 154-year-old Victorian Market in Inverness city centre in March 2014.
The aim was to reduce the arcade's fuel costs and help Inverness towards being designated a Carbon Clever city this year.
The Scottish Greens said the scheme had only now been turned on, but Highland Council said they had operated continuously since their installation.
When installed the solar panels were expected to bring an annual energy cost saving of £500 to £1,000 for the council-run market.
The scheme was also expected to generate £1,200 every year for the Inverness Common Good Fund - a pot of money used to benefit community projects.
Scottish Green MSP Ariane Burgess said work by Green councillors had led to the panels finally being switched on.
Councillor Chris Ballance said: ""It's unbelievable that for 10 years no-one in successive administrations asked the right questions, or demanded solutions, or even seemed to notice the panels hadn't been switched on.""
But Highland Council said electricity generation began during the 2013-14 financial year. 
It said the system had recorded generation during each calendar year since.
The council said all its solar photovoltaic (PV) systems installed across its estate were fully operational from their respective installation dates through to 2022.
A spokesperson said: ""During routine inspections, a number of systems were identified as potentially requiring upgrades to maintain safe operation. 
""In line with our commitment to safety and efficiency, the decision was made to temporarily isolate these systems while a full evaluation of the required works was undertaken.""
The Victorian Market was first opened in 1870.
Its stallholders included butchers, grocers, jewellers and a fish market.
In 1889 the gas-lit property was gutted by a fire. All that was left standing was a stone-built entrance way.
A dog left inside overnight to guard the butcher's shop perished in the blaze.
Within a few years the market was rebuilt and reopened.
A recent redevelopment of the site was completed in 2022. It is a popular attraction for residents and visitors to the Highlands.
Highland Council has been seeking to meet its net-zero targets, including reducing the amount of energy its uses for its properties and fleet of vehicles.
Net zero means no longer adding to the total volume of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Last year, a council report warned of ""limited progress"" in some areas of achieving its aims.
It has a number of other renewable and low-carbon projects.
They include Hydro Ness, which generates electricity from the River Ness at Inverness using an Archimedes screw - a means of drawing water at low level to a higher level using a design attributed by some experts to the ancient Greek scientist Archimedes.
The local authority is building an air source heat pump system to warm Inverness Castle and neighbouring properties.
It has also been piloting the use of electric cargo bikes in some of its staff's work.

350,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g32xn8k2eo,2025-01-23,Residents invited to Paignton engagement event,"People living in Paignton, Devon, have been invited to a residents' engagement event. 
The event on Saturday would focus on the redevelopment and improvement projects under way or about to get under way in the town, organisers said.
Torbay Council said the event stand would would be located outside the New Look in the town centre, from 10:00 GMT until 16:00, and would replace an event which was cancelled in November due to weather. 
It added the bi-monthly events were a chance for the public to meet councillors and council staff and help capture thoughts and feedback on consultations, changes to policies and services.
The public would be able to find out more about the plans for Station Square, the Victoria Centre, the Paignton and Preston Promenade Scheme and the Oldway Mansion restoration project, officials said.
Chris Lewis, council deputy leader and cabinet member for place development and economic growth, said: ""The way we use our town centres has changed. We are at the start of some significant changes being made to Paignton.
""The end result will see the provision of much-needed housing for local people, the area rejuvenated and businesses being attracted back into the town.""
He added that, alongside this, there was a masterplan for the seafront areas which would protect the town from rising sea levels and flooding.
""I'd encourage anyone who lives or works in the bay to come along to the event and have a chat with us to fully understand our plans to ensure Paignton's town centre and high street remains fit for the future,"" he said.

351,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jn7q81g4po,2025-01-23,Team works through night to fix 'vital' Sark link,"A team of five engineers worked through the night to complete repairs to La Coupée before forecast bad weather arrived.
Work on the narrow road connecting the main part of Sark to its southern peninsula was due to carried out between Monday and Friday this week.
With poor weather expected the team managed to complete the rockfall repairs on Tuesday - the road will reopen to traffic on Saturday.
Chris Bardsley, rope supervisor for Geomarine Jersey said ""it was quite a bit worse than it originally looked"".
He said it was ""essentially rubble"" holding the road up and the work involved reinforcing it with steel and concrete.
""It's better than it was"", he said, and he stressed the need for future surveys.
Conseiller John Guille, chairman of Sark's Policy and Finance Committee said erosion of La Coupeé is natural but it needs to be managed.
He said: ""We're perhaps looking at LiDAR [Light Detection and Ranging] surveys, a 3D scan of the cliff face.
""We could do that every year.""
The engineers are heading back to Sark at the ""next available opportunity"" to do a physical assessment of the other western walls and to look at the eastern-side drainage.
Mr Guille said the road was ""a vital link"" and there's ""no option"" but to keep La Coupée functioning.
A statement from Chief Pleas said ""a delay of a few days is required to allow the concrete to reach adequate strength before traffic loads can be applied"".
The road will reopen on Saturday, with a likely restriction for tractors with ""lightly loaded"" trailers only until further inspections are completed.

352,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2yn036qlxo,2025-01-24,Town councils launch pioneering CCTV partnership,"Three Cornwall town councils have launched an initiative that will see their CCTV cameras monitored from one control centre. 
The partnership will allow up to 40 cameras across St Ives, Penzance and Hayle to be managed from a single hub in St Ives.
The councils have worked with local security contractor Infinitus to create the scheme after being faced with the closure of Cornwall Tolvaddon control centre. 
Kim Phillips, director of Infinitus, said the partnership would ""help improve the safety and comfort of people who live, work and visit the area"".
Mayor of Penzance, councillor Stephen Reynolds said the initiative was an example of how town councils ""can work in partnership to find local solutions"".
He said: ""I'm confident that this improved, locally-controlled CCTV monitoring, combined with increased funding from Penzance Council and Penzance BID in street marshals and anti-social behaviour support, will help make our streets safer for everyone.""
Under a three-year contract Infinitus will monitor the cameras, which can also be viewed by the police, and manage requests for data to be viewed.
Insp Dee Evans, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said it was great to see CCTV monitoring controlled locally.
She added: ""This will be advantageous to my officers who utilise CCTV frequently as part of their investigations.
""It will also allow for officers to build up better local connections with our partnership colleagues, which in turn will lead to an increase in public safety and better outcomes for victims.''
